Grunts is a satire of the schlocky high fantasy Tolkien ripoffs of the 70s and 80s. It pokes fun at the aesthetic of the American military as portrayed in film and literature. It combines Grand Guignol (think slapstick but extra gory and violent) dark comedy with satire on bad fantasy.<br/><br/>The story begins with a group of orcs, the Agaku led by the orc Ashnak, tasked with stealing powerful yet non-magical weapons from a dragon's hoard by the nameless necromancer. The pretense for this quest is that these weapons will be useful for the Final Battle between the forces of Light and Dark that's about to happen.<br/><br/>These weapons turn out to be an impressive assortment of modern military equipment: assault rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, tanks, helicopters, surface to air missile launchers...<br/><br/>You name it, they've got it.<br/><br/>The Agaku are your stereotypical generic fantasy orcs: a little stupid, violent, strong. The dragon's hoard of modern military weaponry was cursed with a geas which changes the mindset of the orcs into the stereotypical Vietnam War United States Marine Corps soldier mindset: huuuuuurrah-ing, tabbaco chewing, cigar smoking, a belief that might makes right, etc.<br/><br/>Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/><b>Minor Spoilers Ahead</b><br/><br/>It turns out that the modern military equipment the orc marines have access to isn't enough to turn the tide of the Final Battle. The forces of Light win but many of the forces of Dark, including Ashnak and his orc marines, manage to escape. The orc marines return to their fort in Nin-Edin.<br/><br/>In the following weeks, the forces of Light chase down and ethnically cleanse (we'll get into it) the remaining forces of Dark. This leads to a siege (take a shot every time Mary Gentle depicts a siege in her work) where Ashnak and his orc marines have dug into their fort at Nin-Edin and are preparing to fend off the forces of Light.<br/><br/>Note that all this happens in the first third of the novel, subverting the trope of the not so final Final Battle.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Let's talk about the forces of Light. Epic fantasy has always had a problematic relationship with presenting good/bad in black and white terms with little room in between. My understanding is that this simplicity appeals to the human desire to constantly simplify the eternally complex real world in order to live within it.<br/><br/>That's fine. But by presenting good/bad like this, it's easy to fall into the trap (intentionally or not) of depicting certain beings as inherently evil. <br/><br/>Dehumanizing the human.<br/><br/>Mary Gentle portrays the forces of Light and Dark....<br/><br/>posits that the weapons we have access to change us (power corrupts), she posits that power is power and war is war,<br/><br/>... fantasy satire with grit. Think Terry Pratchett but more mature and with a lot more gore and violence.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>themes to explore: ethnic cleansing, rnd orc with gold eyes (1/8th elven)<br/><br/>Kicking off the book with the ""nameless necromancer"" completely wasted on wine, sending off one of his orc captains on a quest of some sort was a great way to start.<br/><br/>I think this is going to be a goldmine for fantasy roleplaying ideas...<br/><br/><blockquote> ""Ned and Will Brandiman,"" Ned introduced. ""Notorious 'alflings. Sir and madam, you are looking at two of the greatest professionals it will ever be your good fortune to meet. As to what we do, we find lost property.""<br/><br/>Shazgurim snorted. ""And is it usually lost before you two 'find' it?""<br/><br/>""Now that you come to mention it…""<br/><br/>Ashnak nodded his great tusked head. ""Thieves. Our master the nameless said there would be thieves.""<br/><br/>""We prefer the term adventurers. It sounds so much more respectable."" Will brushed himself down and strolled across the dip to look at the ransacked chests. ""You realise it will be necessary to return the tools of our trade? And, now I come to think about it, we have no transport. I think it would probably be advisable for you to detail one of your warriors to carry these chests for us."" </blockquote>",1

When I saw the thickness of the book, the number of lines on each page and the miniscule size of the font, I was scared that I wouldn't be able to read through the whole thing.<br/><br/>All it took for me to get over that fear was reading the first few pages. Mary Gentle hooked me with her commitment to telling Ash's story in a way that only she could and she refused to let go of me until the very end.<br/><br/>That's because Ash - A Secret History is one thousand one hundred and thirteen pages of gold.<br/><br/>Ash - A Secret History is comprised of the following parts:<br/><br/>Historically accurate depictions of war from the perspective of a mercenary captain, Ash, in the late medieval era, written by an expert in the field. Mary Gentle has a Master's in War Studies and her love and deep understanding of the late medieval era shows. It's gritty, it's violent, it's dark but more than anything Mary Gentle is committed to writing a story that feels real.<br/><br/><blockquote> The wax candle melted down to a stump.<br/><br/>I'm prisoner here.<br/><br/>This is no Romance of Arthur or Peredur. I'm not about to scale the walls, fight off armoured men with my bare hands, ride off into the sunshine. What happens to valueless prisoners taken in war is pain first, broken bodies second, and an unmarked, unchristian burial afterwards. I am in their city. They own it now. </blockquote><br/><br/>Fantastical / science fiction story beats that appear in the first few pages and continue to unravel in interesting ways as the story goes on.<br/><br/><blockquote> Snow whirled faster from the invisible whiteness of the sky into the glade. Snow covered the green ivy, the red berries of the holly. Snow froze on the spindly brown arcs of briar. A great huffing animal breath came down from the altar of the ruined green chapel. Ash watched its whiteness on the air. Animal-breath hit her in the face, warm and wet.<br/><br/>A great paw trod down from the stone altar. </blockquote><br/><br/>A frame story told from the perspective of a historian in the late 90s translating a manuscript containing Ash's story.<br/><br/>Each chapter of her story is bookended by emails sent between the historian and his agent. As we understand more about Ash's story, revelations made by the historian and his colleagues in the modern era influence our understanding of Ash's story and vice-versa in a never ending corkscrew of revelations and implications.<br/><br/><blockquote> [...] one must remember that exaggeration, legend, myth, and the chronicler's own prejudices and patriotism, all form a normal part of the average mediaeval manuscript. Under the dross, there is gold. As you will see.<br/><br/>History is a large net, with a wide mesh, and many things slip through it into oblivion. With the new material I have uncovered, I hope to bring to light, once again, those facts which do not accord with our idea of the past, but which, nonetheless, are factual.<br/><br/>That this will then involve considerable reassessment of our views of Northern European history is inevitable, and the historians will just have to get used to it!<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing from you,<br/><br/>Pierce Ratcliff </blockquote><br/><br/>A heavy dose of inspiration from long running soap operas featuring a never ending procession of secrets, mysteries and surprises combined with a revolving door of recurring characters that keep coming back no matter what (unless they die horrific deaths on the field of battle of course), always with a surprise or two under their belt.<br/><br/><blockquote> The priest stared. ""You're a woman!""<br/><br/>Ash muttered, ""That's why I keep you on the company books, Godfrey. Your acumen. Your intelligence. The rapidity with which you penetrate to the heart of the matter."" She shot a look at the lantern and its marked hour-candle, burning steadily where it sat on the trestle table. ""It's nearly Nones. Godfrey, go and give that unruly mob out there a field-mass. Do it! I need time."" </blockquote><br/><br/>If anything you've read here has piqued your interest and you're willing to read one book for 40 hours or more, do yourself a favor and pick up a used copy of Ash - A Secret History and enjoy reading through a story unlike anything else you've read.<br/><br/>I've kept this review short and mostly spoiler-free because you deserve to be able go through Mary Gentle's masterpiece blind. I could say so much more but I'll stop myself here and just pray you give this gigantic brick a chance.<br/><br/>Mary Gentle has gained another loyal fan for life. I'm extremely excited to dig into the rest of her work.<br/><br/>NB: Here's some spoilery thoughts I had about the book while I was reading it, kept here for posterity.<br/><br/>Chapter 1:<br/><br/><spoiler> Oof but I'm intrigued. Summoning a mythological lion (God? a god?) and having it lick the protagonist in what seems to be a historical medieval fantasy story was pretty wild. Starting a book with a violent rape of a child followed by her murdering both of her assailants was wild. I don't know what I was expecting from this text before reading it but it wasn't this. </spoiler><br/><br/>200 pages in<br/><br/><spoiler> like wtf is going on here. The mix and match between extremely grounded medieval historical fiction and the fantasy is cool.<br/><br/>I LOVE a good frame story. The historian losing his shit over previously historical documents being categorized as fiction is great. Some real Knights Templar / AssCreed shit, conspiracy shit.<br/><br/>That's cool but then Ash's story cool AF with a healthy dose rollercoaster ride action sequences, suspense, surprises, intrigue, all wrapped in what feels like an authentic-ish medieval war story told from an interesting POV. </spoiler><br/><br/>400 pages in<br/><br/><spoiler> I am continuing to be amazed by Mary Gentle's ability to combine the mundane reality of running a mercenary company in the late 1400s with the fantasy scenes of 500 priests praying and manifesting a blizzard, a Jewish curse making the Sun disappear from an entire part of the world, Ash's ability to communicate with, essentially, a computer versed in military tactics.<br/><br/>The mundanity makes the fantastic more believable somehow.<br/><br/>Also, Ash is not a stereotypical protagonist. Mary Gentle consistently subverts some of the tropes you might expect to see throughout the text. Ash is not a chosen one, she's special in some ways but not in others.<br/><br/>Initially she is portrayed as being a chosen one of some kind and touched by God, a prophet of battle of sorts. But gradually this shifts as our understanding of the world Ash exists in is deepened. My perception of her shifted and made me think that Ash isn't special or fated to achieve great things because she's touched by God, she's just a product of her upbringing and her genes.<br/><br/>But that understanding of Ash clashes with the fantastical elements present within the book which might lead us to believe that this world has one or more beings of great power, gods of some sort, that act on the world as we know it and who's power can't be fully comprehended by the people affected by it.<br/><br/>Or is it just a story within a story? What parts of Ash's story can we believe to be true within the context of the novel when we're told that the historian who's translating the text is telling us that he's watching his archeologist friend unearthing stone golems as described in the novel.<br/><br/>And does it matter?<br/><br/>Whether Ash was licked by a godlike blue lion in her childhood or not, does it matter? Whether Ash is real or not, does it matter?<br/><br/>To be clear she's not real, but that DOESN'T matter.<br/><br/>The entire text is a defense of fiction as a medium and as a fantastic way to express truth about the world we live in and the lives we live.<br/><br/></spoiler>",1

He had to track the Mind down, he had to go down into the Command System, Idirans or no Idirans, and he had to have the rest of [them] with him.</blockquote><br/><br/>A long time ago in a galaxy without any post-scarcity societies managed by hyper-intelligent AIs (to my knowledge), I read Consider Phlebas once, liked it a lot but, at the time, I wasn't aware that it was part of a larger series so I didn't seek the other books out.<br/><br/>Many years later, I forgot that I had previously Consider(ed) Phlebas, so I picked the book up again, quickly realizing that I had already read it but I decided to continue reading it anyway because I had enjoyed it a lot the first time. Now, I was aware of the Culture series and was interested in reading more of it but I never did.<br/><br/>Many many years later, like now, I realized that reading brings me a lot more joy than I thought it did and so now I spend more of my free time reading because I enjoy it so much. I want to read more of Iain Banks's Culture books, so here we are, re-Consider(ing) Phlebas a third time and it's better than ever.<br/><br/>First things first. Who are we considering exactly? In T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land Phlebas is a drowned sailor who, apparently (I don't know I'm not a poet), represents the futility of death and decay.<br/><br/>Appropriately, Consider Phlebas, the Iain Banks novel, is an anti-war anti-narrative satire of science fiction and space opera stories. Consider Phlebas depicts the meaninglessness of war (instead of valorizing it) through the lens of an anti-hero who mostly sucks, is a conspiracy theorist and, perhaps worst of all given the premise of The Culture books, is a humanoid-focused materialist with a distrust and hatred for the AI intelligences that manage a big chunk of the universe.<br/><br/><blockquote>He looked for the Culture ship, then told himself not to be stupid; it was probably still several trillion kilometres away. That was how divorced from the human scale modern warfare had become. You could smash and destroy from unthinkable distances, obliterate planets from beyond their own system and provoke stars into novae from light-years off... and still have no good idea why you were really fighting.</blockquote><br/><br/>It's not usually preachy and yet contains a lot of philosophical ideas that you can spend a lot of time unpacking if you're into that. I rarely re-read books, there's not enough time in the day for that, but there are some books like Consider Phlebas or <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-11"">Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun</a> that are so dense that they're begging to be.<br/><br/><blockquote>'Don't you have a religion?' Dorolow asked Horza.<br/><br/>'Yes,' he replied, not taking his eyes away from the screen on the wall above the end of the main mess-room table. 'My survival.'<br/><br/>'So... your religion dies with you. How sad,' Dorolow said, looking back from Horza to the screen. The Changer let the remark pass.<br/><br/>The exchange had started when Dorolow, struck by the beauty of the great Orbital, expressed the belief that even though it was a work of base creatures, no better than humans, it was still a triumphant testimony to the power of God, as God had made Man, and all other souled creatures. Horza had disagreed, genuinely annoyed that the woman could use even something so obviously a testament to the power of intelligence and hard work as an argument for her own system of irrational belief.</blockquote><br/><br/>It has the trappings of the genres it's making fun of; some scenes are played straight so unless you're told beforehand that Consider Phlebas is a satire you might not realize it is one until you're halfway through the book. The overarching theme of the meaninglessness of war permeates throughout the entire text and this makes it hard to ignore the satirical tone.<br/><br/><blockquote>They had flown through the scattered stars without encountering anything out of the ordinary: no messages or signals, no distant flashes from battles, no warp wakes. The area around them seemed calm and undisturbed, as though all that was happening was what always happened: just the stars being born and dying, the galaxy revolving, the holes twisting, the gases swirling. The war, in that hurried silence, in their false rhythm of day and night, seemed like something they had all imagined, an inexplicable nightmare they had somehow shared, even escaped.</blockquote><br/><br/>It's got a little bit of everything in it (even some light romance) but don't be surprised when things go a little awry. It's a grim story but it does have many lighter moments; if you're anything like me you'll find yourself chuckling a lot throughout the text. Iain Banks will set up a joke and he'll pay it off 100 pages later with an extremely delayed punchline.<br/><br/><blockquote>He could see some of the others not far away, to his left and right, pushing and striding through the cane grass and bushes with their rifles held high to one shoulder. They were all gradually getting covered in the dark green moss, which Horza supposed might be useful as camouflage (providing, of course, that it didn't turn out to be some horrible, previously undiscovered sentient killer-moss... He told himself to stop being silly).</blockquote><br/><br/>If you're OK with reading a novel that both deconstructs a genre that you may know and love while also taking the piss, you should consider Consider Phlebas.<br/><br/>This might be the last time I re-re-Consider Phlebas for a while, I'll be quite busy reading the other NINE books in the series.<br/><br/>Auuuuasaauuuuaaauuuhhhhhhhhh",1

I had high hopes for that girl, but too much of that sort of nonsense and I think her intelligence will explosively dismantle.'<br/><br/>'Well, such diversions aren't for everybody. She was just trying to be helpful. You'd said you were feeling restless, looking for something new.'<br/><br/>'Well, that wasn't it,' Gurgeh said, and felt suddenly, inexplicably, saddened.<br/></blockquote><br/>Gurgeh has studied and played all the games that exist and none no one can provide him with a challenge. He's sad because he's bored. The Culture might be a post-scarcity society but that doesn't mean that they've completely eliminated unhappiness, they've just reduced its likelihood.<br/><br/><blockquote> 'All reality is a game. Physics at its most fundamental, the very fabric of our universe, results directly from the interaction of certain fairly simple rules, and chance; the same description may be applied to the best, most elegant and both intellectually and aesthetically satisfying games. By being unknowable, by resulting from events which, at the sub-atomic level, cannot be fully predicted, the future remains malleable, and retains the possibility of change, the hope of coming to prevail; victory, to use an unfashionable word. In this, the future is a game; time is one of the rules. Generally, all the best mechanistic games - those which can be played in any sense ""perfectly"", such as grid, Prallian scope, 'nkraytle, chess, Farnic dimensions - can be traced to civilisations lacking a relativistic view of the universe (let alone the reality). They are also, I might add, invariably pre-machine sentience societies.<br/><br/>'The very first-rank games acknowledge the element of chance, even if they rightly restrict raw luck. To attempt to construct a game on any other lines, no matter how complicated and subtle the rules are, and regardless of the scale and differentiation of the playing volume and the variety of the powers and attributes of the pieces, is inevitably to shackle oneself to a conspectus which is not merely socially but techno-philosophically lagging several ages behind our own. As a historical exercise it might have some value. As a work of the intellect, it's just a waste of time. If you want to make something old-fashioned, why not build a wooden sailing boat, or a steam engine? They're just as complicated and demanding as a mechanistic game, and you'll keep fit at the same time.' </blockquote><br/><br/>Gurgeh reciting his past work on games, specifically talking about his preference for games with luck in them because they more accurately reflect the world we live in. If we're to believe that the games we play reflect on the societies we live in and vice-versa, games without luck are bad because that's not how the real world works and it never will. Playing and thinking about games like that will teach us the wrong lessons about the world we live in.<br/><br/><blockquote> The game went on. People came and went around him. The web held all his fortune; the little spheres, holding their secret treasures and threats, became like discrete parcels of life and death, single points of probability which could be guessed at but never known until they were challenged, opened, looked at. All reality seemed to hinge on those infinitesimal bundles of meaning. </blockquote><br/><br/>There are times when the game we're playing, the fiction we're reading or any kind of abstraction of the real world we're immersing ourself in, becomes more important than anything else.<br/><br/><blockquote> Three days passed. He couldn't settle to anything. He tried to read papers, old books, the material of his own he'd been working on - but on every occasion he found himself reading and re-reading the same piece or page or screen, time and time again, trying hard to take it in but finding his thoughts constantly veering away from the words and diagrams and illustrations in front of him, refusing to absorb anything, going back time and time again to the same treadmill, the same looping, tail-swallowing, eternally pointless round of questioning and regret. Why had he done it? What way out was there? </blockquote><br/><br/>When I'm reading, I try to clear my mind and focus on what's on the page but sometimes, no matter what I do, my brain refuses to parse the words on the page, and would rather think about anything else. I acknowledge these moments and try my best to deal with them effectively, either by making a plan to solve whatever problem my mind is stuck thinking about, or by putting the book down and doing some journalling to let these thoughts out onto the page and hopefully in doing so keep them from bouncing around in my mind forever.<br/><blockquote><br/>'I think I see Shohobohaum Za in the crowd,' the drone said as they waited at the exit. Ram's entourage was still cluttering the far end of the ribbon of path held clear by the two lines of policemen.<br/><br/>Gurgeh glanced at the machine, then down the line of arm-linked police. He was still tensed from the game, bloodstream suffused with multifarious chemicals. As happened every now and again, everything he saw around him seemed to be part of the game; the way people stood like pieces, grouped according to who could take or affect whom; the way the pattern on the marquee was like a simple grid-area on the board, and the poles like planted power-sources waiting to replenish some exhausted minor piece and supporting a crux-point in the game; the way the people and police stood like the suddenly closed jaws of some nightmarish pincer-movement… all was the game, everything was seen in its light, translated into the combative imagery of its language, evaluated in the context its structure imposed upon the mind. </blockquote><br/><br/>When you're really immersed in a game and playing it more than you probably should, it's common for those same neurons to start firing when you're not playing the game. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect"">Tetris effect</a> is a common example of this.<br/><br/><blockquote> Anyway, he was awash with a bitter-sweet flood of new and enhanced emotions; the terror of risk and possible defeat, the sheer exultation of the gamble that paid off and the campaign which triumphed; the horror of suddenly seeing a weakness in his position which could lose him the game; the surge of relief when nobody else noticed and there was time to plug the gap; the pulse of furious, gloating glee when he saw such a weakness in another's game; and the sheer unbridled joy of victory. </blockquote><br/><br/>Playing games at a high level and trying your best to win can make you feel like a god.<br/><br/><blockquote> Gurgeh saw many cripples. They sat on street corners, selling trinkets, playing music on scratchy, squeaky instruments, or just begging. Some were blind, some had no arms, some had no legs. Gurgeh looked at the damaged people and felt dizzy; the gritty surface of the street beneath him seemed to tip and heave. For a moment it was as though the city, the planet, the whole Empire swirled around him in a frantic spinning tangle of nightmare shapes; a constellation of suffering and anguish, an infernal dance of agony and mutilation. </blockquote><br/><br/>Ah yes. Living in America, <b>an infernal dance of agony and mutilation</b>.<br/><br/><blockquote> 'Good,' Hamin nodded. 'You see, Gurgeh, one can be on either side in the Empire. One can be the player, or one can be… played upon.' Hamin smiled at what was a play on words in Eächic, and to some extent in Marain too. </blockquote><br/><br/>Everything is a game, or at least can be thought of as a game. Life is a game, an unfair one sadly, and every aspect of it can be thought of as a game. There's a set of rules defined by the physical world around us and the societies we live in. You can't choose to NOT play the game, and if you do you're likely to get played yourself.<br/><br/>If you start off in a privileged position and you can use the rules to your advantage, you're winning. Otherwise, you might not be.<br/><br/>We're all _Morat_, The Player of Games in our own lives. And, I think that's part of why this book is so good. We're all gamers.<br/><br/><blockquote> Gurgeh watched Groasnachek as it fell away beneath them. The city tilted as he was thrown back into his seat; the whole view swung and juddered as the shuttlecraft powered into the hazy skies.<br/><br/>Gradually all the patterns and the shapes came out, revealed for a while before the increasing distance, the city's own vapours, dust and grime, and the altering angle of their climb took it all away.<br/><br/>For all the jumble, it looked momentarily peaceful and ordered in its parts. The distance made its individual, local confusions and dislocations disappear, and from a certain height, where little ever dallied, and almost everything just passed through, it looked exactly like a great, mindless, spreading organism. </blockquote><br/><br/>Iain Banks's ability to write fantastic prose, bring up interesting philosophical conundrums without being preachy about his own beliefs AND tell stories that hook you and never let go, all within the same novel consistently amazes me.<br/><blockquote><br/>So far so average. Our game-player's lucked out again. I guess you can see he's a changed man, though. These humans! I'm going to be consistent, however. I haven't told you who I am so far, and I'm not going to tell you now, either. Maybe later.<br/><br/>Maybe.<br/><br/>Does identity matter anyway? I have my doubts. We are what we do, not what we think. Only the interactions count (there is no problem with free will here; that's not incompatible with believing your actions define you). And what is free will anyway? Chance. The random factor. If one is not ultimately predictable, then of course that's all it can be. I get so frustrated with people who can't see this!<br/><br/>Even a human should be able to understand it's obvious.<br/><br/>The result is what matters, not how it's achieved (unless, of course, the process of achieving is itself a series of results). What difference does it make whether a mind's made up of enormous, squidgy, animal cells working at the speed of sound (in air!), or from a glittering nanofoam of reflectors and patterns of holographic coherence, at lightspeed? (Let's not even think about a Mind mind.) Each is a machine, each is an organism, each fulfils the same task.<br/><br/>Just matter, switching energy of one sort or another.<br/><br/>Switches. Memory. The random element that is chance and that is called choice: common denominators, all.<br/><br/>I say again; you is what you done. Dynamic (mis)behaviourism, that's my creed.<br/><br/>Gurgeh? His switches are working funny. He's thinking differently, acting uncharacteristically. He is a different person. He's seen the worst that meatgrinder of a city could provide, and he just took it personally, and took his revenge.<br/><br/>Now he's spaceborne again, head crammed full of Azad rules, his brain adapted and adapting to the swirling, switching patterns of that seductive, encompassing, feral set of rules and possibilities, and being carted through space towards the Empire's most creakily symbolic shrine: Echronedal; the place of the standing wave of flame; the Fire Planet.<br/><br/>But will our hero prevail? Can he possibly prevail? And what would constitute winning, anyway?<br/><br/>How much has the man still got to learn? What will he make of such knowledge? More to the point, what will it make of him?<br/><br/>Wait and see. It'll work itself out, in time.<br/><br/>Take it from there, maestro…<br/><br/></blockquote>",1
