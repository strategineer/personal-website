9780802163622,2024/12/03,read science-fiction tournament-of-books-2025,read,1,4,"Poetic stream of consciousness-y novel following six astronauts on a space station orbiting the Earth over one day of low earth orbits while they contemplate their lives, the world and the many people they've left behind.<br/><br/>I picked up Orbital because it's a small novel that I could knock out in a day and it came highly recommended.<br/><br/>Samantha Harvey's Orbital reminds me a lot of <a href=""https://strategineer.com/authors/josÃ©-saramago/"">Jose Saramago's work</a> in form because Samantha Harvey doesn't use any punctuation marks for dialog making the prose feel stream of consciousness-y. This makes me feel closer to the POV character's thoughts than I would feel otherwise.<br/><br/>Where Samantha Harvey's writing in Orbital differs from Saramago's is in its content. Saramago is tends to make small changes to the way our world works and then works out how those changes ripple out through people's lives on the page for our reading pleasure.s<br/><br/>On the other hand, in Orbital, Samantha Harvey seems more interested in describing the world as-it is (perhaps shifting the timeline forward a bit) and portraying multiple POVs to express the wide range of the human experience.<br/><br/>The hurricane caused by climate change in Orbital feels more like something that's already happening to us today that we're actively suffering from rather than a maneuver Saramago would make like ""everybody on the planet is becoming blind"" as some kind of metaphor for political ideology / faith gone wrong (see Blindness).<br/><br/>In Orbital, Samantha Harvey doesn't appear to be as militantly atheist as Jose Saramago does but the portrayal of Shaun makes me think that she probably doesn't believe.<br/><br/>I find it hard to believe (see what I did there?) that Shaun, as the only openly religious (Christian to be precise) astronaut on the crew, would go to space, watch as a hurricane rampages on the planet, killing uncountable numbers of people and start to subconsciously and consciously question his faith throughout all of the chapters dedicated to his POV.<br/><br/>That's his main character beat. I found it both hard to believe and a missed opportunity to portray a character who believes in a higher power despite going to space.<br/><br/>One could argue that this new perspective Shaun has on the world could have a profound impact on his belief in God. But given that Orbital presents us with the POVs of six astronauts, I find it a shame that the only openly religious one's only character arc is one of his faith being shaken to the core by the act of going to space.<br/><br/>Using a natural disaster to ""prove"" that an all powerful and benevolent God can't exist is a common argument used in militant atheist spaces. Despite me agreeing with this argument in broad strokes, I find it hard to believe that Shaun wouldn't have encountered it already in his life and built up some kind of religious argument against it.<br/><br/>Basically, I think there's people out there who can believe in God and be astronauts and I would have liked to have seen that on the page even if I'm not a believer myself.",1
9781668092651,2024/12/06,read romance science-fiction thriller tournament-of-books-2025,read,1,5,"A woman working for the Ministry of Time is tasked with helping assimilate a sailor pulled through time, who more than a hundred years prior was on a doomed Arctic expedition and would have died otherwise. Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>I didn't know anything about the Ministry of Time before picking it up and reading it other than it being in contention for the Best Novel of 2024 in certain circles (at least that's what I had understood prior to picking it up).<br/><br/>I ""get"" it. It's an ambitious novel that succeeds at combining multiple genres that usually don't mix in a way that <i>really</i> works.<br/><br/>Kaliane Bradley's The Ministry of Time is something like three parts romance, one part thriller, one part history fiction and one part science fiction. At its heart, it's a romance. There's the constant longing and desire expressed by the protagonist and the ""will they won't they"" throughline that is used to prop up all the other genre tropes Bradley is masterfully juggling.<br/><br/>What surprised me most about The Ministry of Time was the tone. It's vulgar, it's funny, it's sarcastic... in a way that feels natural to me that I don't often see in the novels I read.<br/><br/>Kaliane Bradley, and the narrator in The Ministry of Time, is a ""passing"" mixed race person raised by an immigrant mother displaced from her country and her people. This is relevant to my experience of reading through the novel because it comes up a lot in the text and because this is also my lived experience.<br/><br/>I can't say that Bradley's portrayal of this ""sexy AF sailor plucked straight from the Victorian era"" speaks to me in <b>that</b> way but there's a lot in the Ministry of Time that does. And, it seems obvious to me that this is partially because Bradley, the narrator and I all share this common history of immigrant mothers and how important it is to our understanding who we are, where we belong and how we interact with the world.<br/><br/>It's good, it's entertaining and I feel comfortable boosting the signal of the Ministry of Time in my own little way because of how well it portrays a lived experience of mine that I've never been able to put into words. Seeing parts of that experience expressed in this work that's doing so many other impressive things warms my heart.<br/><br/>Although, I wonder what Bradley's next novel will look like considering that she's obviously self-inserted parts of herself (in a very fan fiction-y way) into the text, as the narrator. What will her next protagonist look like?",1
