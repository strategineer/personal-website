9781250237446,2024/10/11,fantasy slay read,read,1,5,"Gene Wolfe's take on an Alice in Wonderland ""rabbit hole"" story which follows an American teen who finds himself in a layered fantasy world based on Arthurian legend, British folklore, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, and more... All at the same time...<br/><br/>This is something only Gene Wolfe could/would write.<br/><br/>There's a lot to like here and as is common in Wolfe's work, every chapter is filled with more interesting ideas than most novels have. Making for a perfect book club / buddy read book.<br/><br/>Our POV character is Sir Able of the High Heart, an American teen who's physically transformed into a strong adult man's body, but retains his naive and relatively simple mind.<br/><br/>The process of his transformation is particularly fraught and definitely worth thinking about, and I'm interested to see how that all plays out (cw: <spoiler> child abuse </spoiler>).<br/><br/>Able really wants to become a knight, and he's got both the body and the determination for it. With the help of his dog Gylf, his sailor / manservant Pouk, his two fire elf slaves Uri and Baki, his Ogre follower Org and a really big cat (TBD), he's got everything he needs to achieve his goal except wisdom, experience, and brains.<br/><br/>He's got BIG main character energy and he seems fated for success but his path to it isn't as smooth as it could be due to his unique set of weaknesses. <br/><br/>Perhaps, this is one of Wolfe's funniest books due to this discrepancy between your expectations about the story and the curveballs Wolfe's is constantly throwing at the reader.",1

Things quickly go wrong and everyone who's left on the planet is stuck dealing with the consequences of their actions. Our protagonist Renata Ghali in particular is suffering through her existence on the planet and trying to come to terms with her role during Planetfall and the years that followed. <br/><br/>A lot of callbacks to the Planetfall event (when the colonists initially landed on the surface of the planet) without revealing the events specifically. This withholding of critical knowledge is the carrot on the stick that's being used to pull you to the end of the novel but this sort of storytelling is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. It is ""explained"" by the narrator's trauma related to these events but explaining a storytelling device in-universe is not good enough for me to enjoy it. <br/><br/>Other than that, I'm in love with this novel and world. The depiction of someone suffering from a trauma induced hoarding issue is compelling. I've never seen a hoarder depicted in fiction before and I think it's done well here. Having to live with someone with a hoarding issue is something I've experienced and it's nice to see an author attempt, and mostly succeed, at depicting it well from the perspective of the hoarder.<br/><br/>The alien life is alien but the revellation of what it really is and what it's doing is not delivered to the reader in a satisfying way. It's a little too slow and I don't care about it all that much. Knowing what it is lessens my interest in it.",1

At least you can see this in the first few pages unlike in Emma Newman's previous novel in her Planetfall series, which isn't a mystery detective novel but wants to be one. <br/><br/>Compared to its predecessor, After Atlas is way more polished and mostly focuses on developing the interesting parts of the universe but surprisingly retains a super rushed ending that doesn't exactly come out of nowhere but it feels like it.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781473223851/"">Planetfall**</a> ★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781473223875/"">After Atlas</a> ★★★<br/><br/>Another recommendation by <a href=""https://strategineer.com/authors/adrian-tchaikovsky/"">Adrian Tchaikovsky</a>.",1
