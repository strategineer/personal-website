I don't think that was the intention of the author almost one hundred years ago when it was first published but reading it now I was chuckling nonstop at how campy and absurd it is.<br/><br/>Hercules Poiroit, the world famous private investigator specializing in murders, finds himself on a boat on the Nile. He was looking to go on vacation, take a break from his work and relax.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for M. Poirot, there are more than a dozen rich British people on the boat with him capable of murder.<br/><br/>Soon enough a murder is committed and then it's up to M. Poirot and his buddy Colonel Race (who also happens to be on the same boat for some reason) to solve the crime.<br/><br/>Think about what that would actually be like and take a gander at a few scenes I've picked out which had me rolling on the floor laughing.<br/><br/>Scene 1:<br/><br/>Hello world famous private investigator specializing in murder investigations, let me talk to you about who I want to kill in precise detail and also here's the gun I'm going to use.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Scene 2:<br/><br/><b>""So we've got to go somewhere.</b><br/><b>[...] ""I suppose we might as well go on to Egypt. It doesn't make any difference.""</b><br/><b>""It's certainly not a matter of life or death,"" agreed Mrs Otterbourne.</b><br/><b>But there she was quite wrong - for a matter of life and death was exactly what it was.</b><br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Scene 3:<br/><br/><b>""Oh, yes, Mrs Robson. I went over to Paris with Miss Van Schuyler last Fall. But I've never been to Egypt before."" Mrs Robson hesitated.</b><br/><b>""I do hope — there won't be any — trouble.""</b><br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Scene 4:<br/><br/>Lady who is probably going to die: HELLO M. POIROT, PLEASE HELP ME. EVERYONE HATES ME.<br/><br/>I'M GOING TO DIE.<br/><br/>I'M GOING TO DIE.<br/><br/>I'M GOING TO DIE.<br/><br/>M. Poirot: Uhhh chill out lady, don't be melodramatic.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Now, after reading through the whole novel some of the absurdity earlier in the book is explained (it's a mystery after all) but there's no explanation for the extreme campiness other than this being a product of its time.<br/><br/>And, I absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>What didn't I like?<br/>1. Well, the book was written by a British lady almost a hundred years ago so unless you're reading a censored version of the text, you should expect a healthy dose of Imperialism with a side of racism.<br/>2. The campiness dries up about halfway through the book and then ramps back up until the finale. I wasn't as interested in the ""by the numbers solving the mystery"" part of the story. It was fine, probably good even, if that's what you're looking for but I wanted the story to be all camp all the time.<br/><br/>I loved my time with Death on the Nile, if you love camp then you're going to love this book. It's a great book club book!",1

Now, with television joined by more sophisticated electronic media—from the Internet to cell phones to DVDs— it's more relevant than ever.<br/><br/>Despite being published in the 80s, this was a great read.<br/><br/>The Internet is the ""new"" technology that's accelerated us on a path we've been put on by TV initially, many years ago, and ever since then, the way public discourse happens has changed drastically, and not for the better.<br/><br/>The people who get elected today aren't well spoken orators who can reason about the tough societal issues we're faced with, they're Twitter trolls.<br/><br/>This didn't just happen over night and for no good reason. Neil Postman believes that TV (and if he was alive, he would be pointing the finger at the big tech companies I'm sure) is in part to blame for this and through his words he convinced me of this as well.<br/><br/>TV and the Internet are here to stay. The question is: what can we do to stop it from helping bad faith actors from getting and retaining power and ruining things for the rest of us?",1

But, the descriptions of Solaris's space station and the planet it's orbiting were so vivid and interesting that it elevated the story for me.<br/><br/>The space station's color scheme of white combined with stripes of vibrant colors lit by the alternating blue and red hues of the system's both suns was breathtaking.<br/><br/><b> SPOILERS AHEAD </b><br/><spoiler><br/>The station's retrofuturism aesthetic (actual paper books in an actual library for example) combined with the disorder caused by the station's inhabitants slowly losing their minds (or are they?) contrasted beautifully with all of the above.<br/><br/>The story was gripping (and horriffying in a way that I wasn't expecting). Following Kelvin's descent into madness — grappling with the ever present entity that he can't escape from kept me at the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>The philosophical ideas the text puts forth like: ""what makes a person a person vs. a non-person?"" turned the surface level horror into existential dread and spooked the pants off me.<br/><br/>What didn't I like?<br/><br/>There's a few dozen pages of Kelvin reading deep lore about the planet and technobabble in the station's library. I would have trimmed that part down a little bit but it wasn't too bad.<br/><br/>The text is a little dated in parts — we've got at least one slur and a dated reference to autism (""autistic ocean"" hehehehehehe lmaoooooooooo).<br/><br/>Overall though, Solaris is a wild ride with a healthy helping of existential dread on the side that I'm really glad to have read. I can't wait to watch the 1972 movie (based on the book) by Andrei Tarkovsky!<br/><br/></spoiler>",1
9780316388696,2023/09/25,fiction fantasy trash read,read,1,1,"""The Raven Tower"" is one of the worst books I have ever read. I've only covered the tip of the iceberg in this review because reading through this book has left me completely drained of energy. Please don't read this book, it is beyond trash. If you really want to, I can't stop you but I really wish I could.<br/><br/>I have an important question for y'all.<br/><br/>Is this how people speak?<br/><br/><b>""He must have had help, yes. Stalker surely helped him, it was worth her while to do it. Do you think it would be less worth the Raven's, to offer such opportunity to my father? Even with the god so distant, between Instruments, it's a small thing to provide a sharp edge, a weapon in reach, anything. And do you imagine that, offered that help, my father would have failed to take it? He was loyal to the Raven. He was the Lease, and he knew his duty.""</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>On one hand, this is great art because reading through dialogue like this makes me question my own existence. Is it really possible that a human being wrote this paragraph of dialogue and was like: ""Job's done... My God, I'm good!""?<br/><br/>On the other hand, reading dialogue like this is immersion breaking and I don't like it.<br/><br/>It gets worse.<br/><br/>What is the purpose of having characters speaking in awfully written broken English?<br/><br/><b>""A funeral. The old Lease is not have a funeral. There is a new Lease—I know it is so. I am in Vastai for days and days and the Lease is not see us. Now the Lease is see us—once—and this man who is the Lease is not the Lease before.""</b><br/><br/>I'm not an expert linguist so maybe it's possible for someone to learn language X then try to learn language Y and the result of that is this. Maybe?<br/><br/>But why?<br/><br/>I just read through Shards of Earth by Adrian Tchaikovsky which is a book featuring many alien beings who speak in a variety of weird ways all serving to give them a unique identity and immerse you into the world.<br/><br/>Like yes, the crab people speaking through a translator device of questionable quality would be different and the author can use that difference as a tool to craft a more compelling narrative.<br/><br/>And comparing that to this is jarring. Nobody is benefiting from the dialogue being written this way, just let these characters speak normally or make them speak in an interesting way that reflects a difference in their beliefs, unique to them. Something, anything! Not like this.<br/><br/>Let's move on.<br/><br/>Not only is the way the dialogue is written bad but what characters choose to say to each other is also awful.<br/><br/>There are many conversations in this book where each character seems to know everything that every other character knows. It sounds like each of them is reading from a terrible script handed down to them by a single person.<br/><br/>Obviously, all books are written this way. But an author's job is to convince the reader that these characters actually exist, each having their own goals, behaviors, etc. and aren't just mindless puppets controlled entirely by the author.<br/><br/>You could argue that this awful writing is explained by the premise of the book. The fact that the story is narrated by a god in a universe where a god's words have power and in saying something it becomes true.<br/><br/>However, even if that's the case, I dislike when books have premises that explain away the author's inability to write well (refer to I'm Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reid for another example of this)<br/><br/>Is everything in this book terrible? No. But it's hard for me to focus on the OK parts of the book because the bad parts are so bad.<br/><br/>The story is split into two POVs. One of a god and one of a person. The characterization of Eolo, the person, is really bad and his chapters are weak (and filled with awful dialogue). The god's POV is better because it has much less dialogue and it's weird in a way that has potential.<br/><br/>It feels like Ann Leckie wrote a decent story from a unique perspective (the god) and was told that it wouldn't sell because it would be hard for readers to relate to a god who is literally just a big rock.<br/><br/>So, she had to go back in and interlace another story with human characters that people could relate to more easily.<br/><br/>And so, we get a novel that's very uneven with half the chapters being equal parts boring and unbelievable and the other half being not fully realized.<br/><br/>I'm going to add Ann Leckie to my growing list of hack authors who had a single good idea in them.<br/><br/>But that one good idea that made them successful was a fluke. Despite continuously going back to that well, they don't understand what actually made their first successful work resonate with people and so are unable to recreate the success they achieved in the past.<br/><br/>It's sad to see these authors who at one time were put on a pedestal and told: ""Hey, you're special, keep it up!"". Only for everyone to eventually realize that it was all lies. Actually they weren't special, they were lucky.<br/><br/>Everyone's luck runs out at some point, it's not a matter of if but a matter of when. And some authors are luckier than others.<br/><br/>Life's short, I can't afford to waste my time reading a book like this again. Ann Leckie you've been banned, my eyes shall never grace a page of text you've written ever again. I wish you all the best.<br/><br/>Unlucky authors list: Neil Gaiman, Ann Leckie, Jeff VanderMeer",1
9780446676106,2023/10/10,fiction science-fiction read,read,1,4,"I was blown away by the premise of Dawn (the first novel in the trilogy) and its execution. The remnants of humanity, after a nuclear apocalypse occurs, are ""saved"" by aliens and forced to choose between mating with their saviors or never being able to have children again. The rest of the novels didn't hit me as hard but they were interesting nonetheless.<br/><br/>Dawn - 5 stars Adulthood Rites - 3 stars Imago - 3 stars<br/><br/>What follows is mostly me rambling about the series.<br/><br/>This series is about biological determinism, consent, imbalanced power dynamics and sexual violence (among other things). Although, the books don't wrestle with these topics as much as I think they should have.<br/><br/>The first book contains a scene of sexual violence that is really phucked up despite not being very explicit. Overall, this book goes HARD. The imagery is powerful and will stick with me for a long time to come.<br/><br/>Adulthood Rites, the second book in the series, follows, from the POV of a mixed-species boy, the story of humanity repopulating the Earth and the tensions between the settlements of human-alien hybrids and the Human resisters who've chosen to be sterilized but free(ish) from alien influence.<br/><br/>It's not as memorable as the first book. It lacks the novelty and the raw-ness of the first book.<br/><br/>The third book in the series, Imago, follows the story of a one of a kind mixed-species ooloi (neither man or woman, a third sex) as it discovers who it is and what it can do (a lot — it can manipulate the genes of others and itself at will). Despite having an intriguing premise, it's the weakest of the three books. It's ending feels rushed and the lead up to it was disappointing.<br/><br/>It feels as though the series would have been better served by spending more time reckoning with the fact that as the protagonists become less and less human in each book, what comes naturally to them (AKA using pheromones and the best sex skills this side of the universe to have sex with people who ARE NOT biologically capable of providing actual consent) is extremely phucked up and turns them into monsters (at least from the perspective of the reader).<br/><br/>Lilith's Brood is so far removed from the reality that we live in that I found it hard to extrapolate much of anything meaningful from the text other than the absolute rollercoaster ride of emotions that I got from reading the first book.<br/><br/>The text is outlandish but it also seems somewhat uninterested in tackling the ethical issues it takes on through its premise. And so, I felt a little disappointed by the end. I was expecting for a bit more push and pull and more of a focus on the ethics of it all.<br/><br/>Although, I felt that, other than a few minor issues, the world felt internally consistent for the most part. And it was easy for me to immerse myself in the universe that Butler built. Despite feeling somewhat cold on the series as a whole, I'm pretty invested in Butler's writing and I'm interested in reading more from her.<br/><br/>She's blown me away with how bold her writing can be. Nobody else would fill a book with this much rape and get away with it.",1

I enjoyed it but it was missing a bit of polish.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the cast of characters being mostly of Canadian Indigenous ancestry (well, except the villain). It's not something I've seen before (which either speaks to my uncultured-ness or the lack of minority voices in the media I'm exposed to... or both).<br/><br/>The story was simple (maybe too simple) but executed well. But it's definitely not a story for a younger demographic though — it's got a few extremely explicit descriptions of sex in it (I've read some erotica in my day but this was something else).<br/><br/>It's a story about a mixed Indigenous lady, Joan, who's husband goes missing.<br/><br/>We follow Joan as she uncovers the mystery about what really happened to her beloved Victor with the help of her cousin Zeus and her extended family.<br/><br/>There's a few surprises along the way. It was a riveting read although the narrative unfolds in a way that left me scratching my head at times.<br/><br/>The choice to zoom in on the backstory of relatively minor characters was a little weird. An attempt was made to make these characters less like caricatures but it wasn't very successful IMO.<br/><br/>The ending comes out of nowhere with characters doing absolutely wacky shit which was really hard for me to believe. It also happens very quickly. I would have preferred a bit more buildup before the end as well as a bit more of a denouement.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed what I read and I'm excited to read whatever Cherie Dimaline comes up with next. I hope it's little more polished next time though!",1

It's surprising how much of his advice has aged well but given his position of supreme power and the changing times (eg. slavery is bad), some of his meditations have not aged so well.<br/><br/>I recently read Marcus Aurelius's Meditations (translated by Gregory Hays) and I quite enjoyed it.

A torturer? You may leave the guild, you know, if you prefer.""</b><br/><b>I told him firmly — and as though I were slightly shocked by the suggestion — that I had never considered it. It was a lie. I had known, as all the apprentices knew, that one was not firmly and finally a member of the guild until one consented as an adult to the connection. Furthermore, though I loved the guild I hated it too — not because of the pain it inflicted on clients who must sometimes have been innocent, and who must often have been punished beyond anything that could be justified by their offences; but because it seemed to me inefficient and ineffectual, serving a power that was not only ineffectual but remote. I do not know how better to express my feelings about it than by saying that I hated it for starving and humiliating me and loved it because it was my home, hated and loved it because it was the exemplar of old things, because it was weak, and because it seemed indestructible.</b><br/><br/>An older Severian, sitting on his throne, starts writing the story of his life and how he came into the position of power he's, presumably, currently in. The story begins as a coming of age story with Severian describing his youth as a journeyman in the Torturer's Guild. Eventually, he leaves the Tower he has called home for his entire life and embarks on an adventure becoming an executioner for hire where he roams around, kills people for the state, meets a diverse cast of characters and discovers the, absolutely wild, world he lives in.<br/><br/>Gene Wolfe is known for writing stories from the perspective of characters deeply embedded in the narrative. His Book of the New Sun is no exception. Severian doesn't ever do any exposition or go out his way to explain facets of his world that are obvious to him and obvious to the fictional audience he's writing the story for.<br/><br/>Also, Severian is biased, he disguises the truth, he's not always paying attention to what he should be paying attention to and he can't tell the difference between his memories and his dreams.<br/><br/>All of this puts you as the reader in a state of perpetual confusion and forces you to constantly interpret the events, and re-interpret past events, in the novel as you are exposed to more and more contextual information and details revealed by Severian. This framing for the story combined with the far future setting as well Severian's, let's just say unreliability as a narrator, makes for a compelling read.<br/><br/>The meta-ness of it all with Gene Wolfe writing a story about a torturer in a far future for us, the current day, reader, with this torturer writing about himself from his biased and insane perspective for his audience is very compelling.<br/><br/>I could spend hours discussing any randomly chosen paragraph from the first half of the Book of the New Sun. It's dense, multi-faceted and layered unlike anything I've ever read. It's begging to be read multiple times over which I'm already planning to do despite only being halfway through the series as I write this.<br/><br/>The first part of the The Book of the New Sun was published in 1980, way before the era of trigger warnings in novels. If you're sensitive to that, please inform yourself ahead of time before diving into this series because it's grim as hell and contains many events and themes that some people might find uncomfortable (and understandably so).<br/><br/>Barring that, I can recommend this series, or at least what I've read of it so far, to anyone interested in high concept yet grounded sci-fi/fantasy stories.",1

Does she know about my allegiance with Darhat Manjeenonopupu?<br/><br/>Oh. I wish Three Seagrass was here to help me understand what I should do? Oh but we fought a few hours ago for no reason, but I wish we hadn't, but we fought, but I wish we hadn't. I'm a barbarian, I will never be Texcatalllananlanztim. I'll always be an outsider.<br/><br/>Wahhhhhhhhh wahhhhhhh.<br/><br/>""Uhhh are you ok, Mahit?""<br/><br/>Oh no. I haven't said anything in five minutes, because I've been stuck here in an interminable internal monologue that nobody wants to read. God help me...<br/><br/>Heavy sigh.<br/><br/>This book is OK. I think with more time in the oven and some heavy editing it could have been fantastic.<br/><br/>As-is it was really challenging to get through. In particular, the way aliens are handled is heinous.<br/><br/>I almost threw the book across the room when Nine Hibiscus, a military leader in charge of thousands of soldiers, dunked her unprotected hands into the corpse of an unknown alien species.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on when the first question she asks to the medical examiner is the following: ""Are they mammals?""<br/><br/>Nine Hibiscus, please, these aliens seem to have access to technology that may greatly surpass your own. They annihilated hordes of your empire's military like they were ants.<br/><br/>I don't think it's relevant to ask if the alien being in front of you secretes milk out of its breasts.<br/><br/>I've been poisoned by reading Adrian Tchaikovsky's depiction of aliens in his Children of Time series and his The Final Architecture series.<br/><br/>It's done so well in these novels and comparing those depictions with what we get here makes A Desolation Called Peace look real bad.<br/><br/>I'm frustrated and I'm not sure reading more of this book will help with that.<br/><br/>Reading through more of this book, I don't think Arkady Martine knows what a mammal is or how arbitrary of a distinction it is in the context of her story.<br/><br/>Her characters definitely don't. I cannot believe that the mammal fixation is brought up a second time.<br/><br/>If they're mammals we'll be able to speak with them? Ehhhhhhhhhh<br/><br/>A rushed sequel for a book that greatly surpassed expectations and achieved massive critical success.<br/><br/>The constant inconsistencies, the atrocious way the aliens are handled and described is unbelievably bad, the characters's internal monologues going on and on about nothing relevant.<br/><br/>All of this is exhausting. I enjoyed the previous book in the series despite having a few gripes with it but this one is not a great follow up.<br/><br/>I think it succeeds in some ways. Now that the reader is more familiar with the universe, Martine feels comfortable writing the sequel from multiple POVs, in doing so gives herself the opportunity to give us a better sampling of the world.<br/><br/>Does she succeed fully with this? No. The POVs aren't different enough from one another.<br/><br/>But the book feels forced in a way I haven't seen in a novel in a long time. The author starts off with a message about the book being for/by outsiders. But it's not, it tries to be but it's super forced and is coming not from within the story but from without.<br/><br/>Is this a cynical attempt to capture a particular audience? Maybe? I think it's more likely that Martine doesn't understand that good sci fi comes from imagining worlds that are different from our own and seeing how those differences change things and what it might mean for us.<br/><br/>Instead Martine seems to believe that good sci fi is about creating an interesting world and then moving characters from point A to B while they constantly have temper tantrums, eternally question themselves and their skills and fend off assassination attempts.<br/><br/>Every sentence spoken by a character is followed by interminable internal monologuing. Clearly writing like this comes naturally to Martine and sometimes it works but it's too much here.<br/><br/>It's excruciating to read and completely understand someone DNFing this book midway through.<br/><br/>This novel needed more time in the oven and it would have been way better.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a tad satirical. Don't take me too seriously but please do think twice about reading this novel, even if you really enjoyed the previous one. You might be disappointed like I was.<br/><br/>Here's a few reasons why you might give A Desolation Called Peace by Arkady Martine a 5 star review.<br/>- It won the Hugo award for best novel, just like the previous book in the series. Other people seem to like it, I guess I should like it too?<br/>- Both books in the series combined come out to about 1 thousand pages. After spending that much time with a series, it must be good because otherwise look at all this time I've wasted (Sunk Cost Fallacy)<br/>- I really loved A Memory Called Empire, I guess I like the sequel too?<br/><br/>I respect your point of view even if you disagree with mine. But it's so confusing to me, seeing so many people give this novel a perfect score and gush about it, while completely neglecting the aspects of it that are objectively bad.<br/><br/>This novel feels extremely rushed, it likely was rushed out the door by the publisher so that they could most efficiently capitalize on the unexpected acclaim received by the first book. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel after all.<br/><br/>NB: We do live under capitalism. It is what it is.<br/><br/>All the signs of a rushed release are there if you look closely.<br/>1. Awkward run-on sentences are everywhere and cause the reader psychic damage trying to get through them.<br/><br/>Read the following excerpt out loud to see what I mean:<br/><br/><b>The water she'd drunk made her able to talk [author's note: this sentence is atrocious]. Even sing one of the absurd pitched-consonant words that they'd picked up from the aliens in demonstration for the yaotlek, though Mahit was so much better at making those noises that Three Seagrass had begun to plan a scheme in which she taught her how to have some halfway-decent breath and pitch control, pass on the lessons she'd had as a crèche-kid in how to project from the diaphragm when orating.</b><br/><br/>Reading this novel closely, you can and will find many sentences just like this peppered all throughout the text and reading them will drive you insane.<br/><br/>I hate this kind of writing. I don't know where it comes from. It goes against everything I know about good writing. It drives me up the wall.<br/><br/>NB: If you're like me, I highly recommend you also stay away from Ann Leckie's The Raven Tower which suffers from the same kind of long winded writing.<br/>2. The novel has multiple POV characters and their narratorial voices are way too similar and this will encourage you to start drinking, heavily.<br/><br/>Each bit of dialogue, no matter which character's POV we're following, is interspersed with an ungodly amount of stream of consciousness blahblahblah text that is really annoying to read.<br/><br/>If one character was written like this, it's all good. This narration style would define the character and make them unique, and it wouldn't be so overbearing.<br/><br/>The problem is that every single POV character is written like this because I guess that's how Arkady Martine writes and her editor was not given the time and support they needed this time to take out the trash.<br/><br/>Let's look at some examples: <b>Mahit said, ""Well, that's unexpectedly pleasant, all considered,"" and didn't go on any further. She didn't want to—she couldn't tell Three Seagrass that she was here to spy on the war for Darj Tarats, in order to escape Aknel Amnardbat's surgeons. To do worse things for Darj Tarats, if there was an opportunity. She couldn't. So she got into the shuttle instead, settling amongst the supply crates and strapping herself into some freefall-control webbing. There were similar webbings on all of the walls, the floor, the ceiling. It was an efficie""t, well-designed ship. It must make a hundred of these short hops in a month— ""Quite,"" said Three Seagrass, all edges, interest and wariness and a sort of invitation deferred: We can play, Mahit, even if we don't play just now, if playing's what you want.</b><br/><br/>Notice that Arkady Martine explicitly cuts off Mahit's stream of consciousness narration here.<br/><br/>This paragraph is actually cool because there's an intentionality to it. The reader is meant to understand that Mahit is someone who is often stuck in her own head. That's awesome characterization.<br/><br/>The issue is that this narrative voice bleeds into every other character's POV.<br/><br/>For example, in this excerpt, Nine Hibiscus has just been informed by a subordinate that the alien's planet has been found.<br/><br/><b>""If we can get there without them seeing us,"" Nine Hibiscus said. The scatterbombs would do exactly what Eighteen Chisel was imagining. They would, yes, blow anyone out of their sky. And then they'd poison that sky, and the planets below it. The scatterbombs were deathrain. A last resort. Almost never used where people lived— because after them, people didn't live there anymore. She'd only used a scatterbomb barrage once, and that had been against another ship, safe in the blackness of space. The idea of using them on the aliens was— She liked it too much, was what. Liked it too much, too fast. Such a simple solution. So much easier than the rest of the situation she'd been detailing for herself.</b><br/><br/>Huuuuuuuhhhh. Does this sound familiar? If you replace the names in these excerpts, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.<br/><br/>Notice how frequently Arkady Martine uses the ""—"" (em dash) to cut off her character's neverending internal monologues.<br/><br/>You might be wondering, how did I find these examples? Did I carefully sift truth the entire book for the perfect example to present a skewed representation of the book to make my argument more convincing?<br/><br/>No, I opened my book at a random page and found relevant examples each time because the book is filled with them.<br/>3. Final thoughts because reading this book makes me not want to think anymore.<br/><br/>Reading through A Desolation Called Peace has driven me to the brink of insanity and so I find myself ready and able to talk shit about any part of it.<br/>- Arkady Martine's ignorance about biology and linguistics and her decision to hinge her entire novel on these topics that she clearly knows less than nothing about is infuriating.<br/>- Her fixation on the fact that these aliens are mammals (well sort of, wink wink) and how apparently that ISN'T a completely arbitrary distinction to make is wild. If these aliens secret milk out of their breasts, have vertebra and shit, it is not plot critical, please do not fixate on their mammalness.<br/>- Don't get me started on the title of the novel. Cynically, I understand the sequel of a popular book should probably use a similar naming scheme to the first novel to make it clear that it's a sequel and in doing so sell more copies. But, come on, A Desolation Called Peace, is real dumb.<br/><br/>I feel betrayed by the Goodreads and the science fiction community at large for promoting the apparent perfection of this novel.<br/><br/>Although, there are some heroes out there (you know who you are) who knew the truth and tried their best to communicate it, mostly falling on deaf ears.<br/><br/>I should have listened. Maybe then I wouldn't be headed straight for the mental asylum.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a little satirical, please be chill<br/><br/>NB: p. 404, O face due to great diplomacy by Mahit<br/><br/>I've written more than three thousand words between five different first drafts trying to explain exactly why reading A Desolation Called Peace made me so angry. Instead of fumbling with my words, I'll let Ursula K. Le Guin speak for me (quote taken from her essay The Stalin in the Soul).<br/><br/><b>Reading is not a passive reaction, but an action, involving the mind, the emotions, and the will. To accept trashy books because they are ""best-sellers"" is the same thing as accepting adulterated food, ill-made machines, corrupt government, and military and corporative tyranny, and praising them, and calling them the American Way of Life or the American Dream. It is a betrayal of reality. Every betrayal, every lie accepted, leads to the next betrayal and the next lie.</b><br/><br/>Suffice to say that I feel <b>betrayed</b>.<br/><br/>It's clear to me from reading this book closely, that it was rushed to the printing press in an attempt to capitalize on the unexpected (but mostly deserved) acclaim received by the previous book in the series, A Memory Called Empire. With a bit more time in the oven, the sequel could have been fantastic, and yet here we are.<br/><br/>Open the book on any page, put your finger anywhere to find:<br/>- Omnipresent awkward run-on sentences that are begging to be trimmed by a competent editor.<br/>- Multiple POV characters who all suffer from the same never ending stream of consciousness narrative voice that is a pain to read.<br/>- Some absolutely baffling ignorance about aliens, linguistics, the definition of the word ""spy"" and basic biology.<br/><br/>I've rated the book 1 star although it's probably deserving of more (maybe a 2 or a 3), but I need to fight the good fight and do my part to pull this book back into the void where it belongs.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed A Desolation Called Peace, great! Maybe you even rated it 5 stars? Fantastic. I'm truly glad you enjoyed it.<br/><br/>But are you sure that you're really being honest with yourself?<br/><br/>If you don't want to hear what I have to say, fine, but at least listen to Chad Le Guin. If we continue to accept slop like this, praise its greatness, and put it on a pedestal, publishers have no incentive to give authors and editors the time they need to do their best work.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm wrong? Maybe this is really one of the best sci-fi novels of our generation? Maybe the author and the editor and everyone involved got all the time they needed to make A Desolation Called Peace the best it could be.<br/><br/>Well then, if A Desolation Called Peace is the peak of what modern sci-fi can bring to the table, I don't want to read it anymore.",1

It's a game I always come back to over the years.<br/><br/>Reading through the original inspiration for the games was a real pleasure.<br/><br/>Over the many years since the game's were abandoned, fans took up the mantle and continued developing the games, creating a new version of the engine, putting all of the series's maps together and making everything moddable.<br/><br/>The GAMMA mod pack for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. which I've played recently is fantastic and the best realization of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fantasy that the original games promised but couldn't ever truly deliver on.<br/><br/>Thoughts after reading the whole thing:<br/>- Fantastic!<br/>- The book, the movie and the video game series are all doing different things but the book is where it all began — Capturing the imagination of many people and eventually leading to the movie and the games.<br/>- It's short but manages to present a large span of time from a few different perspectives: mainly Red's, who's compelled to keep returning to the Zone over and over again despite the gigantic risk involved.<br/><br/>I loved it, I'm very glad it caught me by surprise at the book store. I just turned around and it was right there in front of me. Like an artifact from the Zone, maybe it had a mind of its own.",1
