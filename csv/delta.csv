They act like a tight knit four man improv group, bouncing off each other really well and provide a great foundation for the humor, action and hijinks in the novel.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780552134620/"">Guards! Guards!***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 7: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780552152679/"">Thud!***</a> ★★★★★<br/><br/>After reading Thud! and enjoying that, I decided to start reading the entire Discworld City/Night Watch series from the start.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes suffers from a combination of alcoholism and depression leading to his skewed perspective of the world.<br/><br/><blockquote>Lessee . . . he'd gone off after the funeral and got drunk. No, not drunk, another word, ended with ‘er'. Drunker, that was it. Because world all twisted up and wrong, like distorted glass, only came back into focus if you looked at it through bottom of bottle.</blockquote><br/><br/>Carrot is a human who was adopted by dwarven parents and so he's essentially a dwarf in a human body.<br/><br/><blockquote>""Oh, give up!"" he said. ""Are you going to come quietly?"" The mumbling went on. The air began to feel hot and dry. Vimes shrugged. ""That's it, then,"" he said, and turned away. ""Throw the book at him, Carrot."" ""Right, sir."" Vimes remembered too late.<br/><br/>Dwarfs have trouble with metaphors. They also have a very good aim. The Laws and Ordinances of Ankh and Morpork caught the [...] on the forehead. He blinked, staggered, and stepped backwards. It was the longest step he ever took. For one thing, it lasted the rest of his life.</blockquote><br/><br/>Nobby is the everyman, he is very down to earth.<br/><br/><blockquote>It always amazed Vimes how Nobby got along with practically everyone. It must, he'd decided, have something to do with the common denominator. In the entire world of mathematics there could be no denominator as common as Nobby.</blockquote><br/><br/>Sergeant Colon is the boomer of the group.<br/><br/><blockquote>Sergeant Colon owed thirty years of happy marriage to the fact that Mrs Colon worked all day and Sergeant Colon worked all night. They communicated by means of notes. He got her tea ready before he left at night, she left his breakfast nice and hot in the oven in the mornings. They had three grown-up children, all born, Vimes had assumed, as a result of extremely persuasive handwriting.</blockquote><br/><br/>These are the men who've been tasked with keeping the city safe. Conveniently, Ankh-Morpork quickly finds itself under attack by a powerful force and Captain Vimes and his constables (with a LOT of help from the larger than life noblewoman Lady Sybil Ramkin and her stable of swamp dragons) are the only people standing in the way of the total destruction of the city.<br/><br/>Guards! Guards! is not my favorite of Terry Pratchett's work. It's one of his earlier novels in the Discworld universe so he's still figuring things out.<br/><br/>The parts where the POV shifts away from the Night Watch (and Sybil) are not as compelling and could have probably been edited away.<br/><br/>But, everything else is great. The jokes land. The characters are paper thin and yet somehow Terry manages to make them come to life anyway. Their chemistry is off the charts and it's a joy to read.<br/><br/>Of course, Carrot being a dwarf in a human body can be read as him being autistic (one of many examples of autistic representation in Terry Pratchett's work).<br/><br/>He takes things very literally. He's oblivious to social cues. It's pretty on the nose.<br/><br/>I appreciate this depiction because despite him being a caricature, every other character is too. He's never the butt of the joke, his actions might be what cause a comical situation to occur but we're not laughing at him. We're laughing at the situation that Carrot and the other constables find themselves in.<br/><br/>Carrot, unlike the rest of Night Watch, seems to be genuinely happy about being a constable (proven by the letters he regularly writes to his parents back home). He has a positive outlook on life and is happy to be where he is. Over time, his positive outlook rubs off on the other constables, gets them to get off their asses and get to work helping people.<br/><br/>Carrot is oblivious to the fact that when he first comes to Ankh-Morpork, he's essentially working as a bouncer for a whorehouse (he believes that the Lady of the house just has a bunch of unmarried daughters).<br/><br/>Sure, he's different but that's OK. This is one example of many in Terry Pratchett's work of characters who are really out there and different and people around them love them anyway.<br/><br/>The implication, whether that was Terry's intent or not, is that you can be different in your own way and you can be loved too.<br/><br/>The real world isn't as simple as a Terry Pratchett novel. But his work is a constant reminder that there's at least one person on the planet who understood a part of my struggle and accepts me (and people like me) for who I am.<br/><br/>If there's one person like Terry out there, there's got to be more. Even though Terry passed away in 2015, the positive influence of his work continues to spread and I suspect (and I hope) that many people will continue to enjoy his work for many generations to come.<br/><br/>His work deserves it.",1

His work has aged beautifully because the world we live in is as absurd as it's ever been and it's only getting more absurd from here on out.<br/><br/>Small Gods is about an autistic savant (pour a drink every time Terry Pratchett includes an autistic character in one of his Discworld books) named Brutha who is a lowly priest/monk in the church of Om. Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>It turns out that Brutha is the only true believer of Om (everyone else only believes in the rules, the hierarchy, the organisation of the church, everything except the actual deity). And so, when Om finds himself reincarnated as a turtle (because only one person believes in him), he can only communicate with Brutha and no one else.<br/><br/>The unlikely pair form a bond and travel together as Brutha, using his eidetic memory, helps Vorbis, the head of the Quisition, with his plan to conquer the blasphemous Ephebians (Greek-esque philosophers).<br/><br/>Along the way, Brutha and Om meet a bunch of wacky characters with whom they discuss religion and philosophy giving Terry Pratchett ample opportunity to poke fun at both.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Small Gods quite a bit. After reading about half a dozen of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, I can say that they feel consistently well written and familiar to me but manage to avoid being formulaic.<br/><br/>There's something about the way he writes that leaves me with a constant smile on my face.

The upcoming anniversary of the thousands years old Battle of Koom Valley is keeping tension high between the dwarves and the trolls; making it harder for the constables of the Watch to keep the peace and solve the crime.<br/><br/>Thud! is a Terry Pratchett novel through and through. There's ample comedy interlaced with impactful action scenes with just a little bit of drama sprinkled in. This time around, it's a little grittier and darker than usual.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780552134620/"">Guards! Guards!***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 7: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780552152679/"">Thud!***</a> ★★★★★<br/><br/><blockquote>It would be a lot simpler [...] if this was a story. A sword is pulled out of a stone or a magic ring is flung into the depths of the sea, and with general rejoicing the world turns.<br/><br/>But this was real life. The world didn't turn, it just went into a spin.</blockquote><br/><br/>Thud! is about prejudice. The main plot as well as every sub plot has something to say about prejudice, how it can cloud our judgement and prevent us from doing the right thing and treating everyone with the respect they deserve.<br/><br/>The choice to have the protagonist be a prototypical white man in a position of power is great because I would have had a hard time taking the novel seriously if Terry Pratchett, a very white man, had chosen to tell this story from the perspective of a minority.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes is an honest man doing the best he can but sometimes that's just not good enough. So, for me, throughout the novel, he flip-flopped between being the hero I was rooting for and the antihero I loved to hate.<br/><br/><b>Minor story spoilers</b><br/><spoiler><br/>An example of this is when Sam Vimes suffers a particularly heinous attack from a few deep dwarves. He feels extremely angry and frustrated about this (rightfully so) but unfortunately he expresses that anger by mistreating other dwarves who had nothing to do with the attack.<br/><br/>This hits home for me because it's something we see time and time again in our own world.<br/><br/>For example, post-911, Muslims around the world suffered from an increase in hate crimes against them. This is a tragedy because the actions of a few extremists (completely divorced from Islam) led to all this hate being directed towards the wrong people. Another more recent example of this was post-COVID, there was a similar increase in hate crimes towards Asian people who, obviously, had nothing to do with COVID, other than suffering because of it like everyone else.<br/><br/>So when Vimes starts getting pissed at dwarves in the same way, it felt real.<br/></spoiler><br/>Thud! is filled with situations like this; touching on issues like discrimination in the workplace, police brutality, racism, etc. that lend a weight to the story that isn't usually present in other Discworld novels. I'm really into it!<br/><br/>Thud! was published right after Going Postal (which is my favorite Discworld novel I've read so far) and they seem to share quite a bit of DNA. With Going Postal dealing with capitalism, toxic corporate culture, bureaucracy (and more!) instead of the topics covered in Thud!.<br/><br/>If you like Going Postal, you might like Thud! (and vice-versa). I love both tremendously.<br/><br/>As of right now, Thud! has taken my second favorite Terry Pratchett novel slot; bumping Thief of Time down to a respectable third place.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with Terry Pratchett. He's just so consistently good at what he does, and I love his work because of it.",1

His art will absolutely floor you time and time again.<br/><br/>The story of Berserk has its ups and downs, but overall I was left disappointed by it. The story feels like a vehicle that constantly thrusts Guts and his crew into contact with the Eldritch and Demonic horrors that Miura excels at drawing. That's great but it's usually not much more than that.<br/><br/>A lot of mysteries and ideas are dropped for effect or as cliffhangers and then completely forgotten as the series goes on. This is the curse of long-running serialized manga and it's something you'll have to deal with if you want to read Berserk.<br/><br/>Random thoughts below:<br/><br/>Oddly enough, a lot of the mercenary captain stuff reminded me of Mary Gentle's Ash: A Secret History. <br/>--- <br/><br/>I'm about 6/41 volumes into the story right now and I'm enjoying it much more than the One Piece chapters I read earlier this year (or last?).

The attention to detail, the emotion, the motion. It's all fantastic.<br/><br/>I also like the story generally.<br/><br/>What don't I like?<br/><br/>Casca getting graped so hard she gets fridged and goes fully pretarded. Guts goes through a similar trauma as a child (although not to the same extent if we want compare them) but he pushes past it as best he can while Casca is completely destroyed by it. It feels a little gratuitous although Griffith being completely broken by a year of torture followed his grape of Casca makes sense if we buy into the ""Griffith is gay for Guts"" angle.<br/><br/>The Lost Children Arc feels like filler and is a little reminder that this is a serialized manga and that the artist's art style, while being the BEST, is probably not sustainable in the long run due to the level of detail in each panel.<br/><br/>The Male Gaze present in the novel, Casca's agency being taken away is made worst by panels lingering on her body and fixated on its weakness and the constant threat of her grape.<br/><br/>Comparing Casca's fragility to Guts, Guts gets hurt constantly but he always gets back up again especially with the help of Puck's fairy dust. But you can't sprinkle fairy dust on Casca's psychological trauma I guess.<br/><br/>It seems like an anti-chosen one story which suffers from similar problems to a chosen one story. Fate and prophecy (and determinism?) play a role in fueling this idea that the suffering of Guts is inevitable and nothing can be done about it. ""The Current of Causality"" is a constant refrain spoken by the Skeleton King that perhaps is meant to communicate both the truth of our inability to change our fate and the futility of fighting against it.<br/><br/>The use of Skeleton Knight Ex Machina a bunch of times gets a little old. Considering the forces Guts is fighting against, it makes sense that he would need a powerful ally in that fight if we want to see him survive. But the Skeleton Knight's motives are unclear and his actions feel unearned at times.",1

It's a documentary about Alejandro Joderowsky's famous, failed, attempt to adapt Frank Herbert's Dune into a movie. The documentary brings to light a sort of crazed artistry that Jodorowsky seems to possess and is compelled to bring forth into the world. Ever since I've been curious to look into his work, I'm glad I finally did.<br/><br/>It seems like The Incal is where a lot of his unspent creative energy went into after his Dune adaptation failed to materialize.<br/><br/>I think the world is better for it. THIS COMIC IS SO GOOD.<br/><br/>There's a lot to love in the Incal but what's blown me away more than anything is how big the scope of the comic is combined with how committed it is to delivering a truly epic tale as efficiently and as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>I'm convinced that with the Incal Jodorowsky and Moebius's shared goal was to blow the reader's mind with every single panel, and failing to do that with every single page.<br/><br/>The journey of John Difool is fast. There's no time wasting, because there's no time to waste. John Difool is being pushed and pulled around by the titular Incal, a powerful object who's purpose is gradually revealed throughout the text, into contact with characters that are as big, metaphorically, as you can imagine and into scenes that are at their best life changing and at their worst extremely exciting.<br/><br/>All the while the universe John Difool exists in is imploding in on itself as galactic empires fight for control of the universe, the underclass riot in an attempt to overthrow aristocrats, the technopope and his techno-techno followers build a gigantic black egg that is more than a little ominous... I could go on.<br/><br/>It's fucking insanity. How can someone read the Incal and not spend their entire life telling everyone they know, maybe everyone full stop, to read it.<br/><br/>It's like a real the King in Yellow kind of situation, or at least it should be.",1

He had to have them on his side. There was no other way he could carry out his mission, and he had come too far, done too much, killed too many people, sunk too much of his own purpose and determination into the task, to back out now. He had to track the Mind down, he had to go down into the Command System, Idirans or no Idirans, and he had to have the rest of [them] with him.</blockquote><br/><br/>A long time ago in a galaxy without any post-scarcity societies managed by hyper-intelligent AIs (to my knowledge), I read Consider Phlebas once, liked it a lot but, at the time, I wasn't aware that it was part of a larger series so I didn't seek the other books out.<br/><br/>Many years later, I forgot that I had previously Consider(ed) Phlebas, so I picked the book up again, quickly realizing that I had already read it but I decided to continue reading it anyway because I had enjoyed it a lot the first time. Now, I was aware of the Culture series and was interested in reading more of it but I never did.<br/><br/>Many many years later, like now, I realized that reading brings me a lot more joy than I thought it did and so now I spend more of my free time reading because I enjoy it so much. I want to read more of Iain Banks's Culture books, so here we are, re-Consider(ing) Phlebas a third time and it's better than ever.<br/><br/>First things first. Who are we considering exactly? In T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land Phlebas is a drowned sailor who, apparently (I don't know I'm not a poet), represents the futility of death and decay.<br/><br/>Appropriately, Consider Phlebas, the Iain Banks novel, is an anti-war anti-narrative satire of science fiction and space opera stories. Consider Phlebas depicts the meaninglessness of war (instead of valorizing it) through the lens of an anti-hero who mostly sucks, is a conspiracy theorist and, perhaps worst of all given the premise of The Culture books, is a humanoid-focused materialist with a distrust and hatred for the AI intelligences that manage a big chunk of the universe.<br/><br/><blockquote>He looked for the Culture ship, then told himself not to be stupid; it was probably still several trillion kilometres away. That was how divorced from the human scale modern warfare had become. You could smash and destroy from unthinkable distances, obliterate planets from beyond their own system and provoke stars into novae from light-years off... and still have no good idea why you were really fighting.</blockquote><br/><br/>It's not usually preachy and yet contains a lot of philosophical ideas that you can spend a lot of time unpacking if you're into that. I rarely re-read books, there's not enough time in the day for that, but there are some books like Consider Phlebas or <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781250781253"">Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun</a> that are so dense that they're begging to be.<br/><br/><blockquote>'Don't you have a religion?' Dorolow asked Horza.<br/><br/>'Yes,' he replied, not taking his eyes away from the screen on the wall above the end of the main mess-room table. 'My survival.'<br/><br/>'So... your religion dies with you. How sad,' Dorolow said, looking back from Horza to the screen. The Changer let the remark pass.<br/><br/>The exchange had started when Dorolow, struck by the beauty of the great Orbital, expressed the belief that even though it was a work of base creatures, no better than humans, it was still a triumphant testimony to the power of God, as God had made Man, and all other souled creatures. Horza had disagreed, genuinely annoyed that the woman could use even something so obviously a testament to the power of intelligence and hard work as an argument for her own system of irrational belief.</blockquote><br/><br/>It has the trappings of the genres it's making fun of; some scenes are played straight so unless you're told beforehand that Consider Phlebas is a satire you might not realize it is one until you're halfway through the book. The overarching theme of the meaninglessness of war permeates throughout the entire text and this makes it hard to ignore the satirical tone.<br/><br/><blockquote>They had flown through the scattered stars without encountering anything out of the ordinary: no messages or signals, no distant flashes from battles, no warp wakes. The area around them seemed calm and undisturbed, as though all that was happening was what always happened: just the stars being born and dying, the galaxy revolving, the holes twisting, the gases swirling. The war, in that hurried silence, in their false rhythm of day and night, seemed like something they had all imagined, an inexplicable nightmare they had somehow shared, even escaped.</blockquote><br/><br/>It's got a little bit of everything in it (even some light romance) but don't be surprised when things go a little awry. It's a grim story but it does have many lighter moments; if you're anything like me you'll find yourself chuckling a lot throughout the text. Iain Banks will set up a joke and he'll pay it off 100 pages later with an extremely delayed punchline.<br/><br/><blockquote>He could see some of the others not far away, to his left and right, pushing and striding through the cane grass and bushes with their rifles held high to one shoulder. They were all gradually getting covered in the dark green moss, which Horza supposed might be useful as camouflage (providing, of course, that it didn't turn out to be some horrible, previously undiscovered sentient killer-moss... He told himself to stop being silly).</blockquote><br/><br/>If you're OK with reading a novel that both deconstructs a genre that you may know and love while also taking the piss, you should consider Consider Phlebas.<br/><br/>This might be the last time I re-re-Consider Phlebas for a while, I'll be quite busy reading the other NINE books in the series.<br/><br/>Auuuuasaauuuuaaauuuhhhhhhhhh",1
