9781401232627,2024/08/16,did-not-finish comics superhero anthology read,read,1,,"Superhero anthology with great art. Focuses on bringing heroes down to earth while maintaining the wonder and awe of superpowers. Astro City is a reconstruction of the superhero genre instead of a deconstruction. It's a precursor to comics like Invincible and the Boys.<br/><br/>Many stories are told from the perspective of regular people living in Astro City, many of the heroes and villains are just regular people with capes. No matter the perspective the story is being told from, Astro City acknowledges that everyone is human and, powers or not, deals with human issues (alien invaders excluded).",1

I'm into it.<br/><br/>The writing is odd. The choice to retain poetic-sounding language with rhymes is a bold one because speech bubbles and their placement prevents the reader from being able to read the lines in the precise manner required to fully appreciate the alliteration and the rhymes of the poetry.<br/><br/>The art is fantastic, it's psychedelic, wavy and colourful. It provides a solid lens through which to really see this sci-fi universe for what it is: one that is malleable, in flux and always being altered by the whims of the Olympian Gods.<br/><spoiler><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781632159274/p10.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""307"" /><br/></spoiler><br/>The choice to interweave the Epic of Gilgamesh into the story as well is kind of wild.
