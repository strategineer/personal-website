Kizzy cried, entering the room.

""You've probably seen a lot of Aandrisks naked before.""<br/><br/>""Yes, but . . . Sissix, the flexibility on this guy, holy shit—"" She stuck her hand toward a bowl of vegetables. Dr. Chef smacked her wrist with a spatula without evenglancing her way.<br/><br/>Sissix sighed. ""What's the name of this vid?""<br/><br/>""Prison Planet 6: The Zero-G Spot.""<br/><br/>""Aaand, we're done,"" Ashby said. ""Honestly, would one day of being polite have killed you?""<br/><br/>""Hey, I'm polite,"" Jenks said. ""I didn't even mention Prison Planet 7.""</b><br/><br/>I picked this book up after being disappointed with <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780765389121/"">John Scalzi's The Kaiju Preservation Society</a>. It's a boring novel but the way John Scalzi fumbles his handling ""woke"" themes / inclusion for clout's sake is pathetic.<br/><br/>Having read <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781473647688/"">The Galaxy, and the Ground Within by Becky Chambers</a> last year and having enjoyed it, I knew that she was interested in and skilled at telling empathetic stories about diverse people, each of them being unique, special in their own way and, most importantly, deserving of love. She tells hopeful stories without shying away from ""real"" issues that don't have easy solutions which makes the happy moments feel more earned.<br/><br/>This is the kind of story I was looking to read and Becky Chambers nailed it. She excels at depicting characters, human and nonhuman alike, in a way that makes it impossible to not empathize with them. And, by doing so, she's able to put her characters in a variety of situations, from the mundane to the exciting and tense, and no matter what the stakes are, I consistently found myself at the edge of my seat with my heart and soul laid bare, ready to feel and interpret the emotional beats that Becky Chambers was laying down.<br/><br/><b>""Thank you,"" Ashby said, though the AI was still speaking. He led the crew away from the booth. Jenks remained behind.<br/><br/>The AI continued on, unfazed by the departure of its audience. ""Location indicators come in models fit for all species, and can provide alerts in a variety of sensory inputs, such as smell, taste, sound, dermal stimulation, neural stimulation—""<br/><br/>""Is Jenks coming?"" Rosemary asked.<br/><br/>""Jenks always waits until the end of the speech,"" Kizzy said with a fond smile. ""Just to be polite.""<br/><br/>Rosemary looked back to the jittery AI. ""That's not a sentient model, is it?""<br/><br/>""I don't think so,"" said Ashby. ""But try telling Jenks that. He always gives AIs the benefit of the doubt.""</b><br/><br/>Sure, there's a galactic federation and universe-spanning political stuff happening. But none of that matters until the moment it impacts the characters's lives (Nothing happens in a vacuum hehe). The characters are the frame through which we see the entire universe of the novel and I love it because Becky Chambers's characters are so vibrant and easy to love.<br/><br/>This focus on character is fantastic to read because Becky Chambers is so good at it. I'd think that more authors (<i>cough</i> John Scalzi <i>cough</i>) would be interested in writing this kind of character-centric story if they could. But I don't think it's that easy even though Becky Chambers makes it look like it is.<br/><br/>I'm dead set on reading more of Becky Chambers's work and you can expect me to do so sooner rather than later.",1
9781473647688,2023/06/21,fiction science-fiction read,read,1,4,"The Galaxy, and the Ground Within is a science fiction novel about a diverse cast of characters from all over the galaxy, stuck at an inter-planetary truck stop for an indeterminate span of time, getting to know one another and helping each other overcome (or make peace with) problems in their personal lives.<br/><br/>As the characters learned about each other and gradually opened up about themselves, I started to see parts of myself reflected in them making me feel invested in the mostly low stakes interactions occurring between the characters.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780062444134/"">The Long Way To A Small, Angry Planet***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 4: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781473647688/"">The Galaxy, And The Ground Within***</a> ★★★★<br/><br/>I've seen complaints about the book not having a plot that propulses the characters forward. Although that's mostly true, I don't think this book needs one.<br/><br/>This is a story about people, it focuses on them and their evolving relationships with one another, finding common ground despite their differences. That's more than enough to keep someone enraptured for however long it takes them to read the book (I know I was).<br/><br/>But if you're looking for a story about a ragtag group of underdogs overcoming stacked odds to save the universe, you'll have to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something a little bit out there, and are ok with reading something with less action, less sex (although there is some of that) and fewer universe ending apocalypses than you're used to, then I can highly recommend this book.<br/><br/>Here be spoilers, you've been warned:<br/><spoiler><br/>The book has an optimistic tone but it isn't wishy-washy when it comes to the grittier topics it tackles. For example, one of the characters, Speaker, is a member of a species that is very clearly a stand-in for Jewish people (systemically oppressed/enslaved, forced to be nomads with no land to call their own, etc).<br/><br/>NB: I would love to hear an expert talk about this portrayal. I can't point fingers necessarily but I definitely raise an eyebrow at the author's choice to portray the Jewish stand-in race as tiny gremlins with hooks for hands.<br/><br/>This book doesn't shy away from portraying the systemic discrimination that Speaker and her species is subjected to. By the end of the book, systemic discrimination isn't ""solved"" but the characters come to terms with their differences, their prejudice and tackle them head on.<br/><br/>This lines up with real world social psychology theories on how to go about successfully breaking down barriers and achieving understanding and compassion between different groups of people. My knowledge of the social psychology behind this combined with this portrayal helped make this story feel believable to me.<br/><br/>One minor complaint I have is that every character has a tragic backstory (or is going through puberty) that is revealed over the course of the book. It feels a little melodramatic but I eventually got over it. Because of this and the fact that most ""scenes"" involve characters standing around and talking to each other, the novel feels more like a dramatic play than a book. This isn't a bad thing, it's just something I noticed.<br/><br/>I think we're going to see a lot of authors copy Becky Chambers's writing style in the coming years. What she's doing in this book seems like a recipe for success and I expect her to cash in on this format, rightfully so. And I'm excited to read the other books she's written in this series, the rest of her work.<br/><br/></spoiler>",1
