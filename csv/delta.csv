9780156007757,2023/10/20,read,read,1,5,"José Saramago refuses to use quotation marks, question marks and exclamation marks in his writing.<br/><br/>José Saramago mostly rejects the idea that paragraphs are a writing tool that exist and can be used to make a text more readable.<br/><br/>José Saramago mostly refuses to name his characters and chooses to refer to them instead by their job, title or some aspect of their appearance (eg. The ""doctor's wife"", the ""girl with the dark glasses"").<br/><br/>Why does José Saramago do this?<br/><br/>I don't know. All I know is that it makes reading his work harder than it needs to be.<br/><br/>If you're able to get past the way he writes, or perhaps even enjoy it if you're some kind of sicko, then you'll usually find an interesting story lying underneath with twists and turns that keep you emotionally invested in the world he's built.<br/><br/>Blindness is by far his most popular work and it's easy to see why. We follow a doctor and his wife during a pandemic of blindness as they, and others affected by the pandemic, are forced into a mental asylum repurposed to contain the newly blind.<br/><br/>The doctor's wife isn't really blind though (she seems to be immune to this new affliction). Lucky for us because the story is mostly told from her perspective.<br/><br/>Through her eyes we watch as the asylum fills up with the blind and we watch as they all struggle to perform the most simple of tasks rendered complex due to their lack of sight and their inexperience with this disability.<br/><br/>Tensions run high and conflict ensues as the last spark of hope is lost and gradually replaced with desperation and hunger for food and for control over their uncertain future.<br/><br/>Blindness (the affliction and the novel) is terrifying. Our eyesight is something we rely on more than any other sense to navigate and interact with the world around us.<br/><br/>The prospect of losing it is appropriately terrifying. Blindness (the novel) turns this fear into a reality we can perceive and forces us to imagine how horrifying it would be for you and everyone you know to lose their eyesight, and the chaos that would follow.<br/><br/>Even with a very surface level reading of the novel, Blindness offers a compelling narrative with meaningful stakes and mostly believable world building that sinks its teeth into you and doesn't let go until the very end.<br/><br/>I say mostly believable because for the most part everything that happens makes sense but I find it very hard to believe that <spoiler>the doctor's wife, the only person who can see in the asylum, couldn't have prevented the horrific series of gang grapes from happening a little earlier.</spoiler><br/><br/>Always remember to put on your suspension of disbelief pants on before reading and you'll be just fine.<br/><br/>If you're looking to read Blindness at a deeper level to unpack what José Saramago is trying to say about the world we live in, you can do that too.<br/><br/>The blindness could be an allegory for the blind faith some people put in ""God"" (Saramago is an atheist and religion plays a role in Blindness so this isn't much of a stretch) or the socio-economic systems that rule our world, ""capitalism"", or any sort of magical thinking that makes us feel better about our lives and the world we live in.<br/><br/>We delude ourselves into thinking about the world in a way that makes us comfortable. But this prevents us from seeing the world around us as it is and prevents us from being at peace with reality as it is instead of reality as we perceive it to be.<br/><br/>I'm no literary critic so take all this with a grain of salt. Whatever you're looking for in a novel, you're likely to find something to latch onto and keep you hooked reading through Blindness as long as you're able to get past José Saramago's obtuse writing style.<br/><br/>I'm excited to dive deeper into the rest of José Saramago's work having read through two of novels and enjoying both of them (All The Names and Blindness).<br/><br/>If you've got any recommendations for me, send them my way! Thanks.",1

I'm a fan of Neil Gaiman's work generally but I found this to be quite boring.<br/><br/>Unlike Greek mythology, we don't have many written records describing Norse mythology as it existed. So, there's not really much we know about Norse mythology.<br/><br/>In his book titled Norse Mythology, Neil Gaiman riffs on what we know about the Norse myths and creates his own retellings of the stories and some completely new ones.<br/><br/>It's OK. I like a lot of Neil Gaiman's work (especially American Gods), his passion for mythology is clear and it shines through most of his work. Unfortunately, I don't think I have as much of an appreciation for Norse mythology as he does and reading this book didn't change that.",1

I enjoyed it but it was missing a bit of polish.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the cast of characters being mostly of Canadian Indigenous ancestry (well, except the villain). It's not something I've seen before (which either speaks to my uncultured-ness or the lack of minority voices in the media I'm exposed to... or both).<br/><br/>The story was simple (maybe too simple) but executed well. But it's definitely not a story for a younger demographic though — it's got a few extremely explicit descriptions of sex in it (I've read some erotica in my day but this was something else).<br/><br/>It's a story about a mixed Indigenous lady, Joan, who's husband goes missing.<br/><br/>We follow Joan as she uncovers the mystery about what really happened to her beloved Victor with the help of her cousin Zeus and her extended family.<br/><br/>There's a few surprises along the way. It was a riveting read although the narrative unfolds in a way that left me scratching my head at times.<br/><br/>The choice to zoom in on the backstory of relatively minor characters was a little weird. An attempt was made to make these characters less like caricatures but it wasn't very successful IMO.<br/><br/>The ending comes out of nowhere with characters doing absolutely wacky shit which was really hard for me to believe. It also happens very quickly. I would have preferred a bit more buildup before the end as well as a bit more of a denouement.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed what I read and I'm excited to read whatever Cherie Dimaline comes up with next. I hope it's little more polished next time though!",1

She's able to construct stories that entice you to keep reading despite the underlying story not being all it's cracked up to be.<br/><br/>Her Villains duology leaves me feeling empty. She knows what the big moments she wants to have in her story are and she constantly steers her characters in the direction of those big moments without it feeling earned.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781783290215/"">Vicious*</a> ★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780765387523/"">Vengeful**</a> ★★<br/><br/>Usually her characters haphazardly waffle about, forcing her to quickly redirect the paths of characters such that the big moments can happen as she imagines them.<br/><br/>But these big moments come out of nowhere and don't feel earned. She has a hard time writing characters that feel real.<br/><br/>The choice to go back and forth between various times allows the author to patch holes in her story to make it make more sense. It also gives her an A plot (present) / B plot (past) to keep you occupied. But it's a crutch that hurts more than it helps because it gives her ample room to hang herself with a paper thin plot and cardboard cutout characters.<br/><br/>To be fair, in Vengeful, the characters have a lot more life to them compared to the first novel. It sucks that none of the characters other than our two heartthrob hot men Eli and Victor (the most shippable pair to ever grace a page) matter or have any sort of character arc.<br/><br/>Every character in this story serves only to set up the final confrontation between Eli and Victor. They don't exist outside of that.<br/><br/>I need a break from V. E. Schwab. Her Darker Shades of Magic series is better than this one overall.<br/><br/>The Villains series is all style no substance. It's the novel equivalent of the Transformer movies. It's a ""Blockbuster"", it's got a lot of flashing lights and cool effects but it lacks anything underneath the surface.<br/><br/>There's nothing stopping someone from writing a great story with sexy shippable pairs of all kinds for fans to write heinously explicit fan fiction about but Vengeful isn't one of them.",1
