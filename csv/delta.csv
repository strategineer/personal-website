This is NOT one of those books.<br/><br/>Chain-Gang All-Stars forces you to think about these topics, and it's uncomfortable. No matter how great the writing and premise is, let me say both are FANTASTIC, this book will be devisive and a lot of people will drop the book. This being the internet, these people will talk a lot of shit without acknowledging that their dislike of the book stems primarily from their political ideology rather than anything to do with the book's quality.<br/><br/>Although, the premise combined with the aesthetic choices (satirical dystopian 80s movies + anime + pro wrestling) make it seem as though the author is trying to cast a wide net and hook people in to read a story like this that they might not have read otherwise if the genre was more mundane and less fantastical.<br/><br/>From page 1, I was immersed in the world presented to me. Adjei-Brenyah's depictions of these dystopian gladiator fights are off the charts compelling.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/pumped.gif"" width=""200"" height=""140"" /><br/><br/>These scenes are written such that it's easy to feel like a spectactor in the arena watching these fights from afar, cheering on your favorite contender and cringing when the fight gets bloody. You get pumped. Reading these scenes I felt like I could hear the crowd chanting all around me.<br/><br/><b>Mel—</b><br/><br/><b>Her left foot fell first, the midsole landed, and she rolled purposefully to her toes before pushing off again. Her body remembered, would always remember, how to run with purpose.</b><br/><br/><b>—an—</b><br/><br/><b>Again, her arms reversed themselves, slipping precisely past each other as her right leg rose and fell, her stride opening still. She was very close. She thought of nothing, put her trust in her body as it sped forward.</b><br/><br/><b>—cholia</b><br/><br/><b>Her arms switchbladed and her legs carried. She continued the push and switch of her arms and legs, forging speed. Her body told her, This speed, me, your body is your weapon.</b><br/><br/>As we get to know the gladiators more personally, what they have to go through to get where they are and why, it becomes much harder to read these fights as ""entertainment"" and more like the prejudiced blood sport that they really are.<br/><br/>I'm about 1/4 of the way through the novel. I'm excited to see where Adjei-Brenyah takes me next and what he has to say.<br/><br/>Adjei-Brenyah went fishing, cast his bait and I'm HOOKED.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/joyride.gif"" width=""200"" height=""100"" />",1
