It's a meh novel but its poor handling of ""woke"" themes is particularly pathetic.<br/><br/>Having read <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781473647688/"">The Galaxy, and the Ground Within</a> by Becky Chambers last year and having really enjoyed it, I knew that she was interested in and skilled at telling empathetic stories about diverse people, unique and deserving of love. She tells hopeful and happy stories without shying away from ""real"" issues which everything in a world that I can believe in.<br/><br/>And yes, I made a great choice. The Long Way To A Small, Angry Planet is a fantastic novel with characters that are so alive and believable that they might as well be leaping off the page.<br/><br/>As soon as each character was introduced, I was so invested in their lives and their relationships with each other.<br/><br/>Becky Chambers excels at depicting characters, human and nonhuman alike, in a way that makes it impossible to not empathize with them. And, in doing so, she's able to create a variety of situations, from the mundane to the exciting, involving her characters and, either way, I'm at the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>I see aspects of myself in most of Becky Chambers's characters because they're so vibrant and fully fleshed out.<br/><br/>Her characters are so good, they drive the entire novel. Sure, there's a plot but the characters are at the forefront of everything that happens. The characters are the frame through which we see the entire universe of the novel and I love it.<br/><br/>Nothing happens in a vacuum (hehe).<br/><br/>This hyper focus on character is fantastic to read and you'd think more authors (<i>cough</i> John Scalzi <i>cough</i>) would be interested in writing this sort of character focused story if they could. But I don't think it's that easy even though Becky Chambers makes it seem so.<br/><br/>I'm dead set on reading more of Becky Chambers's work and you can expect me to do so sooner rather than later.",1
9780143134237,2024/06/23,fiction myth read,read,1,4,"A loosely related sequence of epic poems about transformation(s) inspired by Greek mythology written by Ovid more than two thousand years ago, translated by Stephanie McCarter in 2022.<br/><br/>Of the ancient Greek/Roman texts I've read, Ovid's Metamorphoses is the most self-referential, weird and hard to get into. But if you're willing to stick with it and read more footnotes than you've ever read before, you might enjoy yourself.<br/><br/>The Odyssey, The Iliad and Ovid's Metamorphoses all assume that readers have a certain level of familiarity with Greek/Roman mythology but Ovid goes one step further by assuming that you're familiar with ancient Greek mythology, the Odyssey, the Iliad, the Aeneid AND have a basic understanding of Roman history. All bundled into a collection of loosely related poems with no main character or overarching plot to speak of.<br/><br/>If you're a big Greek mythology nerd like me and you don't mind constantly flipping over to the footnotes then you should be able to read through Ovid's Metamorphoses and get something out of it (even if you haven't read through the Odyssey and/or the Iliad). If you're not a big Greek mythology nerd like me you might get more out of reading the Odyssey first (I really liked Emily Wilson's translation of it).<br/><br/>Not all of Ovid's poetry is created equal. There's a lot of interesting poems here but I've got a few favorites:<br/><br/>Iphis and Ianthe in Book 9 is a poem about Iphis, a woman raised as a boy to appease her father's wish for a son, and the woman she falls in love with, Ianthe. This is a more than two thousand year old poem that can be easily interpreted as being about a woman experiencing gender disphoria leading up to her eventual transformation into a man.<br/><br/><b> When thirteen years had passed, your father, Iphis,<br/><br/>betrothed you to the flaxen-haired Ianthe,<br/><br/>a virgin most renowned of Phaestum's women<br/><br/>for beauty's gift. She was Telestes' daughter<br/><br/>and was your match in age as well as beauty.<br/><br/>They'd learned their early arts, the ABCs,<br/><br/>from the same teachers. Ever since, love touched<br/><br/>their youthful hearts, dealing them equal wounds.<br/><br/>And yet they have unequal hopes. </b><br/><br/>Orpheus and Eurydice in Book 10 is a poem about the bard Orpheus who ventures into the Underworld to find the love of his life, Eurydice, and bring her back to life. Orpheus using his charm and his music convinces the rulers of the Underworld, Hades and Persephone, to let him leave with Eurydice (as long as he can walk all the way back up to the surface without looking at her). His anticipation of seeing her again kills her again as he, inevitably, turns his head to look at her before he's allowed to and because of this she is pulled back down into the Underworld.<br/><br/><b> Gods of the Underworld,<br/><br/>to which we mortal creatures all must sink:<br/><br/>If I can speak the truth, without the riddles<br/><br/>of lying mouths, I've come here not to see<br/><br/>dark Tartarus nor to enchain the three<br/><br/>snaky-haired necks of the Medusan monster,<br/><br/>but for my wife. She stepped upon a snake,<br/><br/>which poisoned her and stole her tender years.<br/><br/>I wanted to be able to endure it<br/><br/>and won't deny I tried. Love conquered me. </b><br/><br/>And this beautiful poem ends with Orpheus being the biggest pussy magnet alive but not wanting any of it. Instead, he ""invents"" pederasty. The End.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/dunno.gif"" width=""200"" height=""200"" /><br/><br/>This poem is fantastic and the ending comes straight out of left field in a way I really enjoy. Ovid subverts expectations in his poems quite a bit but I'm not sure if this ending was meant to be a subversion of expectations, but the passage of time has definitely turned it into one.<br/><br/>Pygmalion and the Ivory Statue in Book 10 is the story of Pygmalion and the ivory statue of a woman he sculpts and, with the help of Venus/Aphrodite, brings to life.<br/><br/><b> Pygmalion watched them pass their lives in crime.<br/><br/>And, outraged by the myriad faults that nature<br/><br/>gave women's minds, he long lived on his own<br/><br/>without a wife and shared his bed with no one. </b><br/><br/>Pygmalion hates women and for some reason, the goddess of love, brings Pygmalion's statue of a woman to life to be his wife. This myth seems to have been completely made up by Ovid which is interesting because the story of Pygmalion has been remixed and retold in popular culture more than any other story from Greco-Roman mythology I can think of. Pinocchio, Frankenstein, Ex Machina, are all steeped in Pygmalion-ness.<br/><br/>Ajax and Ulysses Contend for Achilles' Armor in Book 13 was great. Ovid's commitment to taking a gigantic work like the Iliad and summarizing select parts of it through a legal battle between Ajax and Odysseus is... Chef's Kiss.<br/><br/><b> Grief crushed an uncrushed man. He grabs his sword.<br/><br/>""Is this still mine?"" he asks. ""Or does Ulysses<br/><br/>claim it too? I must use it on myself.<br/><br/>This blade, so often steeped in Trojan gore,<br/><br/>will now be steeped in its own master's blood.<br/><br/>Let nobody but Ajax conquer Ajax.""<br/><br/>He spoke. Into that chest that had not ever<br/><br/>endured a wound he drove his deadly sword. </b><br/><br/>Pythagoras in Book 15 is unlike any other poem in the Metamorphoses. It involves Pythagoras going off on a monologue like no other. Talking about anything and everything in an attempt to synthesize all of Ovid's previous poems and perhaps show the reader a glimpse into the future by prophesizing about the fate of the Roman Empire.<br/><br/><b> The day will end and Phoebus plunge his panting<br/><br/>horses into the deep before I list<br/><br/>everything that transforms. As time too changes,<br/><br/>we see some nations rise and others fall.<br/><br/>Troy, once so great in wealth and men that it<br/><br/>could waste its blood for ten whole years, is lowly<br/><br/>now, and instead of riches it shows off<br/><br/>its ancient ruins and ancestral tombs.<br/><br/>Sparta was famous, great Mycenae strong,<br/><br/>as were the heights of Cecrops and Amphion.<br/><br/>Sparta is cheap soil, tall Mycenae fallen.<br/><br/>What but a name is Oedipus’ Thebes?<br/><br/>And what is Pandion’s Athens but a name? </b><br/><br/>Epilogue in Book 15 is a fantastic way for Ovid to conclude his collection of poems. His work has immortalized him and, despite it being long gone, the influence of the Roman Empire on our modern world is undeniable.<br/><br/><b> I've made a masterpiece Jove's wrath cannot<br/><br/>destroy, nor flame, nor steel, nor gnawing time.<br/><br/>That day, which governs nothing but my body,<br/><br/>can end at will my life's uncertain span.<br/><br/>And yet my finer half will be eternal,<br/><br/>borne among stars. My name can't be erased.<br/><br/>Where Roman power spreads through conquered lands,<br/><br/>I will be read on people's lips. My fame<br/><br/>will last across the centuries. If poets'<br/><br/>prophecies can hold any truth, I'll live. </b><br/><br/>Is there anything I didn't like about Ovid's Metamorphoses?<br/><br/>There's about 250 different myths being recounted in this collection and almost a quarter of them involve sexual violence against women perperated by gods and men. It's a LOT. Stephanie McCarter's translation does not, like many other translations, try to use euphemisms and flowery language to cover up this violence against women. That's a really good thing but it can be a little hard to read. Rape is an inextricable part of Ovid's Metamorphoses and rightfully so, trauma caused by this sort of violence is transformative.<br/><br/>I've never been raped before but I have experienced trauma, like we all have, I've seen its power to change and transform. I found comfort in reading a text written so long ago with a singular focus on this truth about life, that we're all going through a transformation of some sort, becoming something different than what we are today.<br/><br/>There are some poems that are a little too similar to one another in a way that wasn't interesting to me. Although, I wasn't able to give as much attention as I would have liked to each and every poem because how many of them there are and how dense with explanatory footnotes each poem is.<br/><br/>I'm glad I read Ovid's Metamorphoses, if you're a Greek mythology nerd like me or just into poetry, you should give it a try. Reading through it has gotten me excited to read more Roman poetry. I'm thinking of taking a look at Horace's Odes!",1
9780156033688,2024/06/26,fiction historical-fiction slay read,read,1,5,"Ursula K. Le Guin's Greco-Roman mythical retelling from 2008, way before these kinds of novels became ""cool"" and everyone started writing them.<br/><br/>Lavinia tells the story of, well, Lavinia, a character in Vergil's Aeneid who isn't given any speaking lines. Lavinia being such a paper thin character gives Le Guin the opportunity to fill in the many gaps. And, to no one's surprise, she's done a great job of it.<br/><br/><b>Minor story spoilers to follow</b><br/><br/>Le Guin's Lavinia is not a story told straight. At the start of the novel, Vergil, the poet, appears before Lavinia as a spirit and speaks with her at length. Lavinia quickly becomes aware of her future as told by Vergil.<br/><br/>Lavinia also becomes aware of her own existence as a fictional character but also recognizes that Vergil didn't write much about her, leaving her with some semblance of free will. The same can't be said for her husband Aeneas because he's the main character in Vergil's poem.<br/><br/>It's meta, it's weird.<br/><br/>But I like it.<br/><br/>Prior to reading Lavinia, I was familiar with Homer's Odyssey and Iliad but I wasn't familiar with Vergil's Aeneid. Lavinia as a text works better the more you know about Greco-Roman mythology but Le Guin's premise combined with her choice of narrator makes this knowledge less of a requirement and more of a nice to have.<br/><br/>Le Guin's narrator often foreshadows events to come such that whether you're familiar with the Aeneid or not you'll still know what's going to happen.<br/><br/>It works because Lavinia is Le Guin's master class on foreshadowing. Her partially revealing a part of the story to come, often left me much more invested in the novel than I would have been otherwise. Sure, I was told that something was going to happen but the how and why was left open to speculation. Often, I felt as though the revelation of a story beat to come left me with more questions than answers.<br/><br/>It's clear from reading the text but also from Le Guin's afterword that Lavinia was inspired from her reading of Vergil's Aeneid as a Greek tragedy. Le Guin's use of foreshadowing in Lavinia often leads to moments of heightened tension and tragic irony due to the difference between what most of the characters know (Lavinia excluded usually) and what the reader knows. I liked this!<br/><br/>Le Guin wrote Lavinia relatively late in her career and it shows. I feel as though in Lavinia, Le Guin is using all of the skills she's acquired through her long and prolific career and she's nailing it.<br/><br/>You should read it, especially if you're a fan of Le Guin or if you're into Greco-Roman myth/literature!<br/><br/>I've taken note of a bunch of quotes from the book, I'm keeping them here with some of my thoughts for posterity.<br/><br/><b> How is it that you understand me, who lived twenty- five or thirty centuries ago? Do you know Latin?<br/><br/>But then I think no, it has nothing to do with being dead, it's not death that allows us to understand one another, but poetry. </b><br/><br/>Le Guin big upping the use of poetry, and presumably literature as a whole, as an effective means of travelling through time to try and understand the people who came before us.<br/><br/><b> I sat in silence. I wanted to cry, but had no tears. ""I will be gone soon,"" the poet said. ""I will join the crowd, return to darkness.""<br/><br/>""Not yet—""<br/><br/>""Keep me here. Keep me here, Lavinia. Tell me it is better to be alive, better to be a slave living than Achilles dead. Tell me I can finish my work!""<br/><br/>""If you never finish it, it will never end,"" [...] </b><br/><br/>Famously, Vergil never finished writing the Aenied. Potentially leaving more space for artists who came after him, including Le Guin, to take the text, remix it and finish it in a way appropriate for their own time and place.<br/><br/><b> I had hated him while he told that tale of slaughter, but I was losing him, now, already, moment by moment, and I loved him, yearning to him. ""Wait—Only tell me—your poem, my poem, did you finish it?""<br/><br/>He seemed to nod, but I could hardly see him, a tall shadow in shadows.<br/><br/>""Don't go yet—""<br/><br/>""I must go, my glory. I am gone. I join the crowd, return to darkness.""<br/><br/>I cried out his name, went forward, reaching out my arms to hold him, to keep him from death, but it was like holding a breath of the night wind. Nothing was there. </b><br/><br/>The fact that Vergil plays such a big role in Le Guin's retelling of the Aenid constantly amazes me.<br/><br/><b> It has not been difficult for me to believe in my fictionality, because it is, after all, so slight. But for him it would be very difficult. Even if he is at the moment inactive, domesticated, a contented man sitting in the sunlight talking with his wife, the poet's passionate, commanding, anxious, dangerous hero would find it hard to accept contingence, the nullity of his will and conscience. Piety, faithfulness, obedience to what must be rightly done, the fas, is the desire of his heart. To know that he has obeyed a poet, rather than his conscience, might be anguish to him —even if he saw, as I see, that the poet obeyed his conscience and followed the fas. Why should I trouble him with that, when his concerns are so great and his time so short? </b><br/><br/>Lavinia is reflecting on her own existence as a fictional character in someone else's story. Yet, because Vergil did not have much to say about Lavinia, she's more able to believe that she's fictional.<br/><br/>Unlike her husband Aeneas. Of course, this conceit is Le Guin explaining away why Lavinia chooses to stay quiet about Aeneas' future. A novel in which Lavinia does might be interesting but I trust that Le Guin knows what does and doesn't work in a novel.<br/><br/>Either way, very meta stuff.<br/><br/><b> It was a big crowd, and more coming in across the fields all the time. The men all carried weapons, whether they were farm tools or hunter's bows or swords and bronze-tipped lances. As they grouped together they made a dark, endless noise. I looked down from the roof at the top of the laurel in the courtyard where the bees had swarmed. But these men were not the foreigners the bees had foretold. They were Latins, Laurentians, Italians. My people. My enemies. </b><br/><br/>This paragraph is a testament to Le Guin's ability to imbue her work with so much meaning yet she does so, so succinctly.<br/><br/><b>My people. My enemies.</b><br/><br/>Huhhhhh it's so good.<br/><br/><b> I looked for the woman warrior my poet had said would ride with the Volscians, but I did not see her. But then, he said he had invented her. But had he not invented all of us? I tried to take comfort in that, to pretend that it was all a pretense, all the shouted orders and clashed weapons and sharpened swords, the nervous horses and swaggering men. The horrible list of carnage my poet had told me on the last night, that was what they were making ready for. But why, what was it for? For a pet deer? For a girl? What good would that be?<br/><br/>Without war there are no heroes. </b><br/>1. Fiction is as real as any story we tell ourselves about the past or our memories of it. The stories we tell ourselves are a reflection of who we are, and the stories we tell each other change who we are. Whether they're fictional or not.<br/>2. <b>Without war there are no heroes.</b> Le Guin seems to be pointing out an assumption made by the poetic/literary tradition she's been inspired by. To be heroic in a Homeric poem is to be a veteran of war and it seems like that sort of idea has withstood the test of time for better or worse. Something something toxic masculinity.<br/><br/><b> My mind went round and round on these thoughts and my heart was torn and miserable, wanting to rejoice with the people around me but unable to. I felt myself a traitor, as if I had done the great wrong, had caused it simply by being who and what I was. My mother had taught me that self-pitying guilt, and I had known it most of my life. Though I fought against it, knowing it childish and mistaken, under this stress and pressure it was all too easy to be childish, to be mistaken, to drop back into it. </b><br/><br/>Absolutely fucking brutal. Le Guin, you're tearing me apart.<br/><br/><b> ""What am I to do?""<br/><br/>I did feel shame, hearing that.<br/><br/>""Act like a man, for once, if you can't act like a king. If you want to know how a king acts, look at Turnus.""<br/><br/>There was a silence, then a sound of movement, a shift or scuffle, in the dark room, a sharp ""Ah!"" from my mother.<br/><br/>""Enough,"" my father said, even lower, but with a different tone. ""Enough of Turnus. He is not my son, or yours. He is not Lavinia's husband. Or yours. Go back to your rooms now. Keep silent. Do not send any more messengers to Turnus. My men have intercepted them. Even if the Trojans are defeated, that will not make Turnus king of Latium. I will never make him king of Latium. Nor will you! Now go."" </b><br/><br/>Lavinia's mother is absolutely awful, especially to Lavinia. But this scene of spousal violence was tough to read.<br/><br/>Sure, Lavinia's mom is a gigantic cunt. But she also lost two of her children when they were young and that loss has affected her in understandable ways.<br/><br/>I don't think she's portrayed as a particularly sympathetic character, and yet I felt bad for her time and time again.<br/><br/><b> I remember Aeneas' words as I remember the poet's words. I remember every word because they are the fabric of my life, the warp I am woven on. All my life since Aeneas' death might seem a weaving torn out of the loom unfinished, a shapeless tangle of threads making nothing, but it is not so; for my mind returns as the shuttle returns always to the starting place, finding the pattern, going on with it. I was a spinner, not a weaver, but I have learned to weave. </b><br/><br/>The Fates!<br/><br/><b> The women around us bowed their heads or knelt down, and the people crowded into the streets and up on the walls and roofs fell silent listening.<br/><br/>I felt flow into me from them a loving trustfulness, a flood of feeling that humbled my mind and yet gave me a sense of great and reliable support. I was their daughter, their pledge to the future, a powerless girl yet one who could speak for them to the great powers, a mere token for political barter yet also a sign of what was of true value to us all. I stood among my people in silence when the ritual was done, all of us quiet as the birds that stand in hundreds at evening on the sea beach, seeming to worship together.<br/><br/>And so we could hear the noise outside the walls—rumble and clash and crash, neighing and yelling and thunder of hooves and feet, the noise of an army making ready for war. </b><br/><br/>So good.<br/><br/><b> ""Indeed. Women can gain wisdom,"" Ascanius announced, with his irritating, touching pomposity. ""But not true virtue.""<br/><br/>""But what is piety?"" Aeneas asked.<br/><br/>That brought a thoughtful silence.<br/><br/>""Obedience to the will of the powers of earth and sky?"" I said at last, making my statement a question, as women so often do.<br/><br/>""The effort to fulfill one's destiny,"" Achates said.<br/><br/>""Doing right,"" said Illivia, Serestus' wife, a calm, forceful woman from Tusculum, who had become one of my dearest friends.<br/><br/>""What is right in battle, in war?"" Aeneas asked.<br/><br/>""Skill, courage, strength,"" Ascanius answered promptly. ""In war, virtue is piety. Fighting to win!""<br/><br/>""So victory makes right?""<br/><br/>""Yes,"" Ascanius said, and several of the men nodded vigorously; but the older Trojans, some of them, did not. Nor did the women.<br/><br/>""I cannot make it out,"" Aeneas said in his quiet voice. ""I thought what a man knew he ought to do was what he must do. But what if they're not the same? Then, to win a victory is to be defeated. To uphold order is to cause disorder, ruin, death. Virtue and piety destroy each other. I cannot make it out.""<br/><br/>Even Ascanius had no answer for that. </b><br/><b>""Obedience to the will of the powers of earth and sky?"" I said at last, making my statement a question, as women so often do.</b> It sucks that this is the way things are now.<br/><br/><b> ""It's a good place for a child, the woods. You don't learn much about people, but you learn silence. Patience. And that there's nothing much to fear in the wilderness—less than there is on a farm or in the city."" </b><br/><br/>One of Le Guin's many moments in her work where she fantasizes about a ""return to nature"". Also, present in her Earthsea series (Ogion, Ged the farmer).<br/><br/><b> Three years, the poet had said. Three years to the day it was. The three old women who spin and cut the thread had measured exactly, to the inch, nothing to spare. No gift of summer days. </b><br/><br/>The Fates! Again.<br/><br/><b> I have not told this all in order as it happened. It is still hard to speak of. A month after Aeneas' death I lost the fetus that might have been my daughter. Only my women knew that I had been pregnant and that the pregnancy miscarried. Only my women and Aeneas knew. I went with Maruna in the dark before dawn and we buried the tiny scrap of life that had not lived, deep under the great stones of Aeneas' grave. </b><br/><br/>Like her mother, Lavinia loses a child she was hoping to see grow up. There's shared trauma there. As Lavinia lives her life, she gradually comes to understand her mother's behavior and trauma better over time.<br/><br/><b> I did indeed understand something of how my mother's mind worked in her frenzy: the ceaseless whirl of ideas, plans, schemes, the terrible irritation with anything that turned thought from its obsession and with anyone who did not understand it, and the curious sense of waiting in ambush. I remembered two pale gold eyes that shone of their own light. I was the she-wolf in the cave, standing stiff-legged, silent, in darkness, ready. </b><br/><br/>There you go.<br/><br/><b> But as I said it I knew that it was not true. Aeneas had not been there with me as a man in the flesh, nor had Anchises spoken. It was the poet who spoke. It was all the words of the poet, the words of the maker, the foreteller, the truth teller: nothing more, nothing less. But was I myself any more, or less, than that?<br/><br/>And this was nothing I could say to any living soul, or ever did, till now. </b><br/><br/>Lavinia grappling again with her fictionality and what it means for her.<br/><br/>Meta meta meta.<br/><br/><b> But after a time I began to like my solitude. I lost the wish for any visitor or voice to break the silence of the trees, threaded always with the singing of insects and birds and the sound of wind in leaves. I gardened, and spun, and wove on the big loom set up in the second room, and was content with silence, until my son came back at evening to eat with me and talk a little, quietly, before sleep. </b><br/><br/>""RETURN TO NATURE. RETURN TO NATURE. RETURN TO NATURE.""<br/><br/>_Le Guin slowly rocked back and forth, hugging her knees to her chest as she repeated those faithful words._<br/><br/><b> I was fated, it seems, to live among people who suffered beyond measure from grief, who were driven mad by it. Though I suffered grief, I was doomed to sanity. This was no doing of the poet's. I know that he gave me nothing but modest blushes, and no character at all. I know that he said I raved and tore my golden tresses at my mother's death. He simply was not paying attention: I was silent then, tearless, and only intent on making her poor soiled body decent. And my hair has always been dark. In truth he gave me nothing but a name, and I have filled it with myself. Yet without him would I even have a name? I have never blamed him. Even a poet cannot get everything right.<br/><br/>It is strange, though, that he gave me no voice. I never spoke to him till we met that night by the altar under the oaks. Where is my voice from, I wonder? the voice that cries on the wind in the heights of Albunea, the voice that speaks with no tongue a language not its own? </b><br/><br/>The Fates! Again again.<br/><br/><b> I fly among the trees on soft wings that make no sound. Sometimes I call out, but not in a human voice. My cry is soft and quavering: i, i, I cry: Go on, go.<br/><br/>Only sometimes my soul wakes as a woman again, and then when I listen I can hear silence, and in the silence his voice. </b><br/><br/>Le Guin's Lavinia ends with a bang.",1

Yet, The Other Wind is the most ""fantasy"" fantasy book in the Earthsea series, featuring many tropes that you may have seen before (tropes: <spoiler>a restoration narrative, a mage haunted by his dark past, a king's romance with a princess from another land, a conflict occurring on the edges of the known world, etc. </spoiler>) yet subverts or manages to make each of these tropes more interesting and grounded in reality than they would otherwise be if written by a less competent author.<br/><br/><b>""Maybe your gift will come back to you, when what must happen has happened.

What I love about it most is how well Le Guin manages to do perspective shifting between the different POV characters, some new and some returning from previous books in the series.<br/><br/>In doing so, Le Guin manages to show us the characters we've been following through their journeys so far, where they're at now and where they're going as well as giving us the most comprehensive view on the inner workings of the world of Earthsea we've gotten in the series so far. It's rare for a final book in a series to hit as hard as the first, The Other Wind got pretty close for me.<br/><br/><b>So, here in the center where earth's powers met, the human powers had also met together: a king, a princess, the masters of wizardry.</b><br/><b>And the dragons. And a priestess-thief turned farmwife, and a village sorcerer with a broken heart...</b><br/><br/>It's a great conclusion to the series. Now that I've read the whole series I can confirm with certainty that the third book, The Farthest Shore, is not worth reading, unless you're a super fan who needs to know just how bad it is. The Other Wind feels like Le Guin's rerun of The Farthest Shore in more ways than one. Thankfully, The Other Wind succeeds where The Farthest Shore does not.",1

They act like a tight knit four man improv group, bouncing off each other really well and provide a great foundation for the humor, action and hijinks in the novel.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780552134620/"">Guards! Guards!***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 7: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780552152679/"">Thud!***</a> ★★★★★<br/><br/>After reading Thud! and enjoying that, I decided to start reading the entire Discworld City/Night Watch series from the start.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes suffers from a combination of alcoholism and depression leading to his skewed perspective of the world.<br/><br/><b>Lessee . . . he'd gone off after the funeral and got drunk. No, not drunk, another word, ended with ‘er'. Drunker, that was it. Because world all twisted up and wrong, like distorted glass, only came back into focus if you looked at it through bottom of bottle.</b><br/><br/>Carrot is a human who was adopted by dwarven parents and so he's essentially a dwarf in a human body.<br/><br/><b>""Oh, give up!"" he said. ""Are you going to come quietly?"" The mumbling went on. The air began to feel hot and dry. Vimes shrugged. ""That's it, then,"" he said, and turned away. ""Throw the book at him, Carrot."" ""Right, sir."" Vimes remembered too late.</b><br/><b>Dwarfs have trouble with metaphors. They also have a very good aim. The Laws and Ordinances of Ankh and Morpork caught the [...] on the forehead. He blinked, staggered, and stepped backwards. It was the longest step he ever took. For one thing, it lasted the rest of his life.</b><br/><br/>Nobby is the everyman, he is very down to earth.<br/><br/><b>It always amazed Vimes how Nobby got along with practically everyone. It must, he'd decided, have something to do with the common denominator. In the entire world of mathematics there could be no denominator as common as Nobby.</b><br/><br/>Sergeant Colon is the boomer of the group.<br/><br/><b>Sergeant Colon owed thirty years of happy marriage to the fact that Mrs Colon worked all day and Sergeant Colon worked all night. They communicated by means of notes. He got her tea ready before he left at night, she left his breakfast nice and hot in the oven in the mornings. They had three grown-up children, all born, Vimes had assumed, as a result of extremely persuasive handwriting.</b><br/><br/>These are the men who've been tasked with keeping the city safe. Conveniently, Ankh-Morpork quickly finds itself under attack by a powerful force and Captain Vimes and his constables (with a LOT of help from the larger than life noblewoman Lady Sybil Ramkin and her stable of swamp dragons) are the only people standing in the way of the total destruction of the city.<br/><br/>Guards! Guards! is not my favorite of Terry Pratchett's work. It's one of his earlier novels in the Discworld universe so he's still figuring things out.<br/><br/>The parts where the POV shifts away from the Night Watch (and Sybil) are not as compelling and could have probably been edited away.<br/><br/>But, everything else is great. The jokes land. The characters are paper thin and yet somehow Terry manages to make them come to life anyway. Their chemistry is off the charts and it's a joy to read.<br/><br/>Of course, Carrot being a dwarf in a human body can be read as him being autistic (one of many examples of autistic representation in Terry Pratchett's work).<br/><br/>He takes things very literally. He's oblivious to social cues. It's pretty on the nose.<br/><br/>I appreciate this depiction because despite him being a caricature, every other character is too. He's never the butt of the joke, his actions might be what cause a comical situation to occur but we're not laughing at him. We're laughing at the situation that Carrot and the other constables find themselves in.<br/><br/>Carrot, unlike the rest of Night Watch, seems to be genuinely happy about being a constable (proven by the letters he regularly writes to his parents back home). He has a positive outlook on life and is happy to be where he is. Over time, his positive outlook rubs off on the other constables, gets them to get off their asses and get to work helping people.<br/><br/>Carrot is oblivious to the fact that when he first comes to Ankh-Morpork, he's essentially working as a bouncer for a whorehouse (he believes that the Lady of the house just has a bunch of unmarried daughters).<br/><br/>Sure, he's different but that's OK. This is one example of many in Terry Pratchett's work of characters who are really out there and different and people around them love them anyway.<br/><br/>The implication, whether that was Terry's intent or not, is that you can be different in your own way and you can be loved too.<br/><br/>The real world isn't as simple as a Terry Pratchett novel. But his work is a constant reminder that there's at least one person on the planet who understood a part of my struggle and accepts me (and people like me) for who I am.<br/><br/>If there's one person like Terry out there, there's got to be more. Even though Terry passed away in 2015, the positive influence of his work continues to spread and I suspect (and I hope) that many people will continue to enjoy his work for many generations to come.<br/><br/>His work deserves it.",1

The upcoming anniversary of the thousands years old Battle of Koom Valley is keeping tension high between the dwarves and the trolls; making it harder for the constables of the Watch to keep the peace and solve the crime.<br/><br/>Thud! is a Terry Pratchett novel through and through. There's ample comedy interlaced with impactful action scenes with just a little bit of drama sprinkled in. This time around, it's a little grittier and darker than usual.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780552134620/"">Guards!

The world didn't turn, it just went into a spin.</b><br/><br/>Thud! is about prejudice. The main plot as well as every sub plot has something to say about prejudice, how it can cloud our judgement and prevent us from doing the right thing and treating everyone with the respect they deserve.<br/><br/>The choice to have the protagonist be a prototypical white man in a position of power is great because I would have had a hard time taking the novel seriously if Terry Pratchett, a very white man, had chosen to tell this story from the perspective of a minority.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes is an honest man doing the best he can but sometimes that's just not good enough. So, for me, throughout the novel, he flip-flopped between being the hero I was rooting for and the antihero I loved to hate.<br/><br/><b>Minor story spoilers</b><br/><spoiler><br/>An example of this is when Sam Vimes suffers a particularly heinous attack from a few deep dwarves. He feels extremely angry and frustrated about this (rightfully so) but unfortunately he expresses that anger by mistreating other dwarves who had nothing to do with the attack.<br/><br/>This hits home for me because it's something we see time and time again in our own world.<br/><br/>For example, post-911, Muslims around the world suffered from an increase in hate crimes against them. This is a tragedy because the actions of a few extremists (completely divorced from Islam) led to all this hate being directed towards the wrong people. Another more recent example of this was post-COVID, there was a similar increase in hate crimes towards Asian people who, obviously, had nothing to do with COVID, other than suffering because of it like everyone else.<br/><br/>So when Vimes starts getting pissed at dwarves in the same way, it felt real.<br/></spoiler><br/>Thud! is filled with situations like this; touching on issues like discrimination in the workplace, police brutality, racism, etc. that lend a weight to the story that isn't usually present in other Discworld novels. I'm really into it!<br/><br/>Thud! was published right after Going Postal (which is my favorite Discworld novel I've read so far) and they seem to share quite a bit of DNA. With Going Postal dealing with capitalism, toxic corporate culture, bureaucracy (and more!) instead of the topics covered in Thud!.<br/><br/>If you like Going Postal, you might like Thud! (and vice-versa). I love both tremendously.<br/><br/>As of right now, Thud! has taken my second favorite Terry Pratchett novel slot; bumping Thief of Time down to a respectable third place.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with Terry Pratchett.

Some real Knights Templar / AssCreed shit, conspiracy shit.<br/><br/>That's cool but then Ash's story cool AF with a healthy dose rollercoaster ride action sequences, suspense, surprises, intrigue, all wrapped in what feels like an authentic-ish medieval war story told from an interesting POV. </spoiler><br/><br/>400 pages in<br/><br/><spoiler> I am continuing to be amazed by Mary Gentle's ability to combine the mundane reality of running a mercenary company in the late 1400s with the fantasy scenes of 500 priests praying and manifesting a blizzard, a Jewish curse making the Sun disappear from an entire part of the world, Ash's ability to communicate with, essentially, a computer versed in military tactics.<br/><br/>The mundanity makes the fantastic more believable somehow.<br/><br/>Also, Ash is not a stereotypical protagonist. Mary Gentle consistently subverts some of the tropes you might expect to see throughout the text. Ash is not a chosen one, she's special in some ways but not in others.<br/><br/>Initially she is portrayed as being a chosen one of some kind and touched by God, a prophet of battle of sorts. But gradually this shifts as our understanding of the world Ash exists in is deepened. My perception of her shifted and made me think that Ash isn't special or fated to achieve great things because she's touched by God, she's just a product of her upbringing and her genes.<br/><br/>But that understanding of Ash clashes with the fantastical elements present within the book which might lead us to believe that this world has one or more beings of great power, gods of some sort, that act on the world as we know it and who's power can't be fully comprehended by the people affected by it.<br/><br/>Or is it just a story within a story? What parts of Ash's story can we believe to be true within the context of the novel when we're told that the historian who's translating the text is telling us that he's watching his archeologist friend unearthing stone golems as described in the novel.<br/><br/>And does it matter?<br/><br/>Whether Ash was licked by a godlike blue lion in her childhood or not, does it matter? Whether Ash is real or not, does it matter?<br/><br/>To be clear she's not real, but that DOESN'T matter.<br/><br/>The entire text is a defense of fiction as a medium and as a fantastic way to express truth about the world we live in and the lives we live.<br/><br/></spoiler>",1

You have to constantly give reasons to explain why they don't just kill everybody and achieve their evil goals. More than either of the two previous books, I had to shut my brain off and just enjoy the ride no matter how implausible the plot felt at times.<br/>- Giving minor characters their own POV chapters brought a lot of life into them. Making the world feel a little more interesting and less centered around the larger than life main characters. Unfortunately all these characters are eventually killed off, which ends up feeling a little cheap.<br/>- Kell is a bit of a boring character. He doesn't really have an arc or change at all from the start of the story all the way through to the end. That said, most characters in this series are pretty stable in terms of their goals and beliefs throughout the story but at least they're a bit more interesting than Kell.<br/>- The side story where most of the main characters escape from the city in search of the MacGuffin feels like filler. Also, I hate MacGuffins.<br/>- A bunch of characters bite their lip and I don't think that's an actual thing people do (other than in Twilight).

I had known, as all the apprentices knew, that one was not firmly and finally a member of the guild until one consented as an adult to the connection. Furthermore, though I loved the guild I hated it too — not because of the pain it inflicted on clients who must sometimes have been innocent, and who must often have been punished beyond anything that could be justified by their offences; but because it seemed to me inefficient and ineffectual, serving a power that was not only ineffectual but remote. I do not know how better to express my feelings about it than by saying that I hated it for starving and humiliating me and loved it because it was my home, hated and loved it because it was the exemplar of old things, because it was weak, and because it seemed indestructible.</b><br/><br/>An older Severian, sitting on his throne, starts writing the story of his life and how he came into the position of power he's, presumably, currently in. The story begins as a coming of age story with Severian describing his youth as a journeyman in the Torturer's Guild. Eventually, he leaves the Tower he has called home for his entire life and embarks on an adventure becoming an executioner for hire where he roams around, kills people for the state, meets a diverse cast of characters and discovers the, absolutely wild, world he lives in.<br/><br/>Gene Wolfe is known for writing stories from the perspective of characters deeply embedded in the narrative. His Book of the New Sun is no exception. Severian doesn't ever do any exposition or go out his way to explain facets of his world that are obvious to him and obvious to the fictional audience he's writing the story for.<br/><br/>Also, Severian is biased, he disguises the truth, he's not always paying attention to what he should be paying attention to and he can't tell the difference between his memories and his dreams.<br/><br/>All of this puts you as the reader in a state of perpetual confusion and forces you to constantly interpret the events, and re-interpret past events, in the novel as you are exposed to more and more contextual information and details revealed by Severian. This framing for the story combined with the far future setting as well Severian's, let's just say unreliability as a narrator, makes for a compelling read.<br/><br/>The meta-ness of it all with Gene Wolfe writing a story about a torturer in a far future for us, the current day, reader, with this torturer writing about himself from his biased and insane perspective for his audience is very compelling.<br/><br/>I could spend hours discussing any randomly chosen paragraph from the first half of the Book of the New Sun. It's dense, multi-faceted and layered unlike anything I've ever read.

Although that's mostly true, I don't think this book needs one.<br/><br/>This is a story about people, it focuses on them and their evolving relationships with one another, finding common ground despite their differences. That's more than enough to keep someone enraptured for however long it takes them to read the book (I know I was).<br/><br/>But if you're looking for a story about a ragtag group of underdogs overcoming stacked odds to save the universe, you'll have to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something a little bit out there, and are ok with reading something with less action, less sex (although there is some of that) and fewer universe ending apocalypses than you're used to, then I can highly recommend this book.<br/><br/>Here be spoilers, you've been warned:<br/><spoiler><br/>The book has an optimistic tone but it isn't wishy-washy when it comes to the grittier topics it tackles. For example, one of the characters, Speaker, is a member of a species that is very clearly a stand-in for Jewish people (systemically oppressed/enslaved, forced to be nomads with no land to call their own, etc).<br/><br/>NB: I would love to hear an expert talk about this portrayal. I can't point fingers necessarily but I definitely raise an eyebrow at the author's choice to portray the Jewish stand-in race as tiny gremlins with hooks for hands.<br/><br/>This book doesn't shy away from portraying the systemic discrimination that Speaker and her species is subjected to. By the end of the book, systemic discrimination isn't ""solved"" but the characters come to terms with their differences, their prejudice and tackle them head on.<br/><br/>This lines up with real world social psychology theories on how to go about successfully breaking down barriers and achieving understanding and compassion between different groups of people. My knowledge of the social psychology behind this combined with this portrayal helped make this story feel believable to me.<br/><br/>One minor complaint I have is that every character has a tragic backstory (or is going through puberty) that is revealed over the course of the book. It feels a little melodramatic but I eventually got over it. Because of this and the fact that most ""scenes"" involve characters standing around and talking to each other, the novel feels more like a dramatic play than a book. This isn't a bad thing, it's just something I noticed.<br/><br/>I think we're going to see a lot of authors copy Becky Chambers's writing style in the coming years. What she's doing in this book seems like a recipe for success and I expect her to cash in on this format, rightfully so. And I'm excited to read the other books she's written in this series, the rest of her work.<br/><br/></spoiler>",1

It feels like a writer's exercise and not something meant to be read by readers.<br/><br/>The two first short stories were written by Le Guin before she wrote the first Earthsea book, both of these are interesting in that they contain familiar yet distinct ideas which Le Guin would build on and refine in Earthsea.<br/><br/>The essay she wrote after writing Tehanu gives some context on how Le Guin felt about the series as a whole, her thoughts on fantasy, the heroic mode and its problematic yet intimate ties with masculinity and gender. She discusses how, with Tehanu, she tried to break some of these assumptions and genre tropes that are inherently mysoginistic which she believed to have replicated in the first three books in the Earthsea series.<br/><br/>The last two stories seemed to have been written after she wrote the final published book in the series. One being quite disconnected from the rest of the Earthsea stories we've read so far but interesting in its own way. The other presenting us with the death of one of the characters instrumental to the series.

I haven't said anything in five minutes, because I've been stuck here in an interminable internal monologue that nobody wants to read. God help me...<br/><br/>Heavy sigh.<br/><br/>This book is OK. I think with more time in the oven and some heavy editing it could have been fantastic.<br/><br/>As-is it was really challenging to get through. In particular, the way aliens are handled is heinous.<br/><br/>I almost threw the book across the room when Nine Hibiscus, a military leader in charge of thousands of soldiers, dunked her unprotected hands into the corpse of an unknown alien species.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on when the first question she asks to the medical examiner is the following: ""Are they mammals?""<br/><br/>Nine Hibiscus, please, these aliens seem to have access to technology that may greatly surpass your own. They annihilated hordes of your empire's military like they were ants.<br/><br/>I don't think it's relevant to ask if the alien being in front of you secretes milk out of its breasts.<br/><br/>I've been poisoned by reading Adrian Tchaikovsky's depiction of aliens in his Children of Time series and his The Final Architecture series.<br/><br/>It's done so well in these novels and comparing those depictions with what we get here makes A Desolation Called Peace look real bad.<br/><br/>I'm frustrated and I'm not sure reading more of this book will help with that.<br/><br/>Reading through more of this book, I don't think Arkady Martine knows what a mammal is or how arbitrary of a distinction it is in the context of her story.<br/><br/>Her characters definitely don't. I cannot believe that the mammal fixation is brought up a second time.<br/><br/>If they're mammals we'll be able to speak with them? Ehhhhhhhhhh<br/><br/>A rushed sequel for a book that greatly surpassed expectations and achieved massive critical success.<br/><br/>The constant inconsistencies, the atrocious way the aliens are handled and described is unbelievably bad, the characters's internal monologues going on and on about nothing relevant.<br/><br/>All of this is exhausting. I enjoyed the previous book in the series despite having a few gripes with it but this one is not a great follow up.<br/><br/>I think it succeeds in some ways. Now that the reader is more familiar with the universe, Martine feels comfortable writing the sequel from multiple POVs, in doing so gives herself the opportunity to give us a better sampling of the world.<br/><br/>Does she succeed fully with this? No. The POVs aren't different enough from one another.<br/><br/>But the book feels forced in a way I haven't seen in a novel in a long time. The author starts off with a message about the book being for/by outsiders. But it's not, it tries to be but it's super forced and is coming not from within the story but from without.<br/><br/>Is this a cynical attempt to capture a particular audience? Maybe? I think it's more likely that Martine doesn't understand that good sci fi comes from imagining worlds that are different from our own and seeing how those differences change things and what it might mean for us.<br/><br/>Instead Martine seems to believe that good sci fi is about creating an interesting world and then moving characters from point A to B while they constantly have temper tantrums, eternally question themselves and their skills and fend off assassination attempts.<br/><br/>Every sentence spoken by a character is followed by interminable internal monologuing. Clearly writing like this comes naturally to Martine and sometimes it works but it's too much here.<br/><br/>It's excruciating to read and completely understand someone DNFing this book midway through.<br/><br/>This novel needed more time in the oven and it would have been way better.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a tad satirical. Don't take me too seriously but please do think twice about reading this novel, even if you really enjoyed the previous one. You might be disappointed like I was.<br/><br/>Here's a few reasons why you might give A Desolation Called Peace by Arkady Martine a 5 star review.<br/>- It won the Hugo award for best novel, just like the previous book in the series. Other people seem to like it, I guess I should like it too?<br/>- Both books in the series combined come out to about 1 thousand pages. After spending that much time with a series, it must be good because otherwise look at all this time I've wasted (Sunk Cost Fallacy)<br/>- I really loved A Memory Called Empire, I guess I like the sequel too?<br/><br/>I respect your point of view even if you disagree with mine. But it's so confusing to me, seeing so many people give this novel a perfect score and gush about it, while completely neglecting the aspects of it that are objectively bad.<br/><br/>This novel feels extremely rushed, it likely was rushed out the door by the publisher so that they could most efficiently capitalize on the unexpected acclaim received by the first book. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel after all.<br/><br/>NB: We do live under capitalism. It is what it is.<br/><br/>All the signs of a rushed release are there if you look closely.<br/>1. Awkward run-on sentences are everywhere and cause the reader psychic damage trying to get through them.<br/><br/>Read the following excerpt out loud to see what I mean:<br/><br/><b>The water she'd drunk made her able to talk [author's note: this sentence is atrocious]. Even sing one of the absurd pitched-consonant words that they'd picked up from the aliens in demonstration for the yaotlek, though Mahit was so much better at making those noises that Three Seagrass had begun to plan a scheme in which she taught her how to have some halfway-decent breath and pitch control, pass on the lessons she'd had as a crèche-kid in how to project from the diaphragm when orating.</b><br/><br/>Reading this novel closely, you can and will find many sentences just like this peppered all throughout the text and reading them will drive you insane.<br/><br/>I hate this kind of writing. I don't know where it comes from. It goes against everything I know about good writing. It drives me up the wall.<br/><br/>NB: If you're like me, I highly recommend you also stay away from Ann Leckie's The Raven Tower which suffers from the same kind of long winded writing.<br/>2. The novel has multiple POV characters and their narratorial voices are way too similar and this will encourage you to start drinking, heavily.<br/><br/>Each bit of dialogue, no matter which character's POV we're following, is interspersed with an ungodly amount of stream of consciousness blahblahblah text that is really annoying to read.<br/><br/>If one character was written like this, it's all good. This narration style would define the character and make them unique, and it wouldn't be so overbearing.<br/><br/>The problem is that every single POV character is written like this because I guess that's how Arkady Martine writes and her editor was not given the time and support they needed this time to take out the trash.<br/><br/>Let's look at some examples: <b>Mahit said, ""Well, that's unexpectedly pleasant, all considered,"" and didn't go on any further. She didn't want to—she couldn't tell Three Seagrass that she was here to spy on the war for Darj Tarats, in order to escape Aknel Amnardbat's surgeons. To do worse things for Darj Tarats, if there was an opportunity. She couldn't. So she got into the shuttle instead, settling amongst the supply crates and strapping herself into some freefall-control webbing. There were similar webbings on all of the walls, the floor, the ceiling. It was an efficie""t, well-designed ship. It must make a hundred of these short hops in a month— ""Quite,"" said Three Seagrass, all edges, interest and wariness and a sort of invitation deferred: We can play, Mahit, even if we don't play just now, if playing's what you want.</b><br/><br/>Notice that Arkady Martine explicitly cuts off Mahit's stream of consciousness narration here.<br/><br/>This paragraph is actually cool because there's an intentionality to it. The reader is meant to understand that Mahit is someone who is often stuck in her own head. That's awesome characterization.<br/><br/>The issue is that this narrative voice bleeds into every other character's POV.<br/><br/>For example, in this excerpt, Nine Hibiscus has just been informed by a subordinate that the alien's planet has been found.<br/><br/><b>""If we can get there without them seeing us,"" Nine Hibiscus said. The scatterbombs would do exactly what Eighteen Chisel was imagining. They would, yes, blow anyone out of their sky. And then they'd poison that sky, and the planets below it. The scatterbombs were deathrain. A last resort. Almost never used where people lived— because after them, people didn't live there anymore. She'd only used a scatterbomb barrage once, and that had been against another ship, safe in the blackness of space. The idea of using them on the aliens was— She liked it too much, was what. Liked it too much, too fast. Such a simple solution. So much easier than the rest of the situation she'd been detailing for herself.</b><br/><br/>Huuuuuuuhhhh. Does this sound familiar? If you replace the names in these excerpts, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.<br/><br/>Notice how frequently Arkady Martine uses the ""—"" (em dash) to cut off her character's neverending internal monologues.<br/><br/>You might be wondering, how did I find these examples? Did I carefully sift truth the entire book for the perfect example to present a skewed representation of the book to make my argument more convincing?<br/><br/>No, I opened my book at a random page and found relevant examples each time because the book is filled with them.<br/>3. Final thoughts because reading this book makes me not want to think anymore.<br/><br/>Reading through A Desolation Called Peace has driven me to the brink of insanity and so I find myself ready and able to talk shit about any part of it.<br/>- Arkady Martine's ignorance about biology and linguistics and her decision to hinge her entire novel on these topics that she clearly knows less than nothing about is infuriating.<br/>- Her fixation on the fact that these aliens are mammals (well sort of, wink wink) and how apparently that ISN'T a completely arbitrary distinction to make is wild. If these aliens secret milk out of their breasts, have vertebra and shit, it is not plot critical, please do not fixate on their mammalness.<br/>- Don't get me started on the title of the novel. Cynically, I understand the sequel of a popular book should probably use a similar naming scheme to the first novel to make it clear that it's a sequel and in doing so sell more copies. But, come on, A Desolation Called Peace, is real dumb.<br/><br/>I feel betrayed by the Goodreads and the science fiction community at large for promoting the apparent perfection of this novel.<br/><br/>Although, there are some heroes out there (you know who you are) who knew the truth and tried their best to communicate it, mostly falling on deaf ears.<br/><br/>I should have listened. Maybe then I wouldn't be headed straight for the mental asylum.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a little satirical, please be chill<br/><br/>NB: p. 404, O face due to great diplomacy by Mahit<br/><br/>I've written more than three thousand words between five different first drafts trying to explain exactly why reading A Desolation Called Peace made me so angry. Instead of fumbling with my words, I'll let Ursula K. Le Guin speak for me (quote taken from her essay The Stalin in the Soul).<br/><br/><b>Reading is not a passive reaction, but an action, involving the mind, the emotions, and the will. To accept trashy books because they are ""best-sellers"" is the same thing as accepting adulterated food, ill-made machines, corrupt government, and military and corporative tyranny, and praising them, and calling them the American Way of Life or the American Dream. It is a betrayal of reality. Every betrayal, every lie accepted, leads to the next betrayal and the next lie.</b><br/><br/>Suffice to say that I feel <b>betrayed</b>.<br/><br/>It's clear to me from reading this book closely, that it was rushed to the printing press in an attempt to capitalize on the unexpected (but mostly deserved) acclaim received by the previous book in the series, A Memory Called Empire. With a bit more time in the oven, the sequel could have been fantastic, and yet here we are.<br/><br/>Open the book on any page, put your finger anywhere to find:<br/>- Omnipresent awkward run-on sentences that are begging to be trimmed by a competent editor.<br/>- Multiple POV characters who all suffer from the same never ending stream of consciousness narrative voice that is a pain to read.<br/>- Some absolutely baffling ignorance about aliens, linguistics, the definition of the word ""spy"" and basic biology.<br/><br/>I've rated the book 1 star although it's probably deserving of more (maybe a 2 or a 3), but I need to fight the good fight and do my part to pull this book back into the void where it belongs.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed A Desolation Called Peace, great! Maybe you even rated it 5 stars? Fantastic. I'm truly glad you enjoyed it.<br/><br/>But are you sure that you're really being honest with yourself?<br/><br/>If you don't want to hear what I have to say, fine, but at least listen to Chad Le Guin. If we continue to accept slop like this, praise its greatness, and put it on a pedestal, publishers have no incentive to give authors and editors the time they need to do their best work.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm wrong? Maybe this is really one of the best sci-fi novels of our generation? Maybe the author and the editor and everyone involved got all the time they needed to make A Desolation Called Peace the best it could be.<br/><br/>Well then, if A Desolation Called Peace is the peak of what modern sci-fi can bring to the table, I don't want to read it anymore.",1

Him and his kind were built as better, stronger, faster and, most importantly, more obedient replacements for human soldiers (the military-industrial complex tried to build fully autonomous robots prior to developing Bioforms but that didn't end very well).<br/><br/>A chip in Rex's brain feeds him the right kind of brain chemicals when he's a ""Good Dog"" and the bad kind of chemicals when he's being a ""Bad Dog"" which is how his Master trains Rex and his fellow Bioforms to do as their told. Right from page 1, it's clear that Rex and his squad of Bioforms are being used to commit heinous war crimes (yikes) but aren't aware that what they're doing is wrong.<br/><br/>Rex's ability to reason, understand morality and the world around him is relatively low at the start of the book.

A lot of effort was put into gradually changing Rex's way of thinking throughout the book and having that change be reflected in the prose.

The POV gimmick of Bear Head is cool with Jimmy and Honey's sentient personality upload occupying the same headspace (literally) and the story being told from his perspective and then hers. Also, Honey's personality upload gradually ""coming to life"" by unraveling Honey's memories to learn who she was and who she is now is great.

The chapters told from the perspective of Thompson's PA Springer are not as much of a highlight as the Jimmy and Honey chapters. Her perspective is important and usually adds to the overall narrative but we spend a bit too much time with her, repeating the same themes over and over again. Very early on you get the impression that Thompson is the devil incarnate, spending more time following his story doesn't really do anything to deepen that past the first few chapters.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Dogs of War, you'll likely want to read Bear Head and get quite a lot out of it but don't expect it to reach that same high.",1

He had to track the Mind down, he had to go down into the Command System, Idirans or no Idirans, and he had to have the rest of [them] with him.</b><br/><br/>A long time ago in a galaxy without any post-scarcity societies managed by hyper-intelligent AIs (to my knowledge), I read Consider Phlebas once, liked it a lot but, at the time, I wasn't aware that it was part of a larger series so I didn't seek the other books out.<br/><br/>Many years later, I forgot that I had previously Consider(ed) Phlebas, so I picked the book up again, quickly realizing that I had already read it but I decided to continue reading it anyway because I had enjoyed it a lot the first time. Now, I was aware of the Culture series and was interested in reading more of it but I never did.<br/><br/>Many many years later, like now, I realized that reading brings me a lot more joy than I thought it did and so now I spend more of my free time reading because I enjoy it so much. I want to read more of Iain Banks's Culture books, so here we are, re-Consider(ing) Phlebas a third time and it's better than ever.<br/><br/>First things first. Who are we considering exactly? In T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land Phlebas is a drowned sailor who, apparently (I don't know I'm not a poet), represents the futility of death and decay.<br/><br/>Appropriately, Consider Phlebas, the Iain Banks novel, is an anti-war anti-narrative satire of science-fiction and space opera stories. Consider Phlebas depicts the meaninglessness of war (instead of valorizing it) through the lens of an anti-hero who mostly sucks, is a conspiracy theorist and, perhaps worst of all given the premise of The Culture books, is a humanoid-focused materialist with a distrust and hatred for the AI intelligences that manage a big chunk of the universe.<br/><br/><b>He looked for the Culture ship, then told himself not to be stupid; it was probably still several trillion kilometres away.

I rarely re-read books, there's not enough time in the day for that, but there are some books like Consider Phlebas or <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-11"">Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun</a> that are so dense that they're begging to be.<br/><br/><b>'Don't you have a religion?'

The Changer let the remark pass.</b><br/><b>The exchange had started when Dorolow, struck by the beauty of the great Orbital, expressed the belief that even though it was a work of base creatures, no better than humans, it was still a triumphant testimony to the power of God, as God had made Man, and all other souled creatures. Horza had disagreed, genuinely annoyed that the woman could use even something so obviously a testament to the power of intelligence and hard work as an argument for her own system of irrational belief.</b><br/><br/>It has the trappings of the genres it's making fun of; some scenes are played straight so unless you're told beforehand that Consider Phlebas is a satire you might not realize it is one until you're halfway through the book. The overarching theme of the meaninglessness of war permeates throughout the entire text and this makes it hard to ignore the satirical tone.<br/><br/><b>They had flown through the scattered stars without encountering anything out of the ordinary: no messages or signals, no distant flashes from battles, no warp wakes. The area around them seemed calm and undisturbed, as though all that was happening was what always happened: just the stars being born and dying, the galaxy revolving, the holes twisting, the gases swirling. The war, in that hurried silence, in their false rhythm of day and night, seemed like something they had all imagined, an inexplicable nightmare they had somehow shared, even escaped.</b><br/><br/>It's got a little bit of everything in it (even some light romance) but don't be surprised when things go a little awry. It's a grim story but it does have many lighter moments; if you're anything like me you'll find yourself chuckling a lot throughout the text.

He told himself to stop being silly).</b><br/><br/>If you're OK with reading a novel that both deconstructs a genre that you may know and love while also taking the piss, you should consider Consider Phlebas.<br/><br/>This might be the last time I re-re-Consider Phlebas for a while, I'll be quite busy reading the other NINE books in the series.<br/><br/>Auuuuasaauuuuaaauuuhhhhhhhhh",1

Physics at its most fundamental, the very fabric of our universe, results directly from the interaction of certain fairly simple rules, and chance; the same description may be applied to the best, most elegant and both intellectually and aesthetically satisfying games. By being unknowable, by resulting from events which, at the sub-atomic level, cannot be fully predicted, the future remains malleable, and retains the possibility of change, the hope of coming to prevail; victory, to use an unfashionable word. In this, the future is a game; time is one of the rules. Generally, all the best mechanistic games - those which can be played in any sense ""perfectly"", such as grid, Prallian scope, 'nkraytle, chess, Farnic dimensions - can be traced to civilisations lacking a relativistic view of the universe (let alone the reality). They are also, I might add, invariably pre-machine sentience societies.<br/><br/>'The very first-rank games acknowledge the element of chance, even if they rightly restrict raw luck. To attempt to construct a game on any other lines, no matter how complicated and subtle the rules are, and regardless of the scale and differentiation of the playing volume and the variety of the powers and attributes of the pieces, is inevitably to shackle oneself to a conspectus which is not merely socially but techno-philosophically lagging several ages behind our own. As a historical exercise it might have some value. As a work of the intellect, it's just a waste of time. If you want to make something old-fashioned, why not build a wooden sailing boat, or a steam engine? They're just as complicated and demanding as a mechanistic game, and you'll keep fit at the same time.' </b><br/><br/>Gurgeh reciting his past work on games, specifically talking about his preference for games with luck in them because they more accurately reflect the world we live in. If we're to believe that the games we play reflect on the societies we live in and vice-versa, games without luck are bad because that's not how the real world works and it never will. Playing and thinking about games like that will teach us the wrong lessons about the world we live in.<br/><br/><b> The game went on. People came and went around him. The web held all his fortune; the little spheres, holding their secret treasures and threats, became like discrete parcels of life and death, single points of probability which could be guessed at but never known until they were challenged, opened, looked at. All reality seemed to hinge on those infinitesimal bundles of meaning. </b><br/><br/>There are times when the game we're playing, the fiction we're reading or any kind of abstraction of the real world we're immersing ourself in, becomes more important than anything else.<br/><br/><b> Three days passed. He couldn't settle to anything. He tried to read papers, old books, the material of his own he'd been working on - but on every occasion he found himself reading and re-reading the same piece or page or screen, time and time again, trying hard to take it in but finding his thoughts constantly veering away from the words and diagrams and illustrations in front of him, refusing to absorb anything, going back time and time again to the same treadmill, the same looping, tail-swallowing, eternally pointless round of questioning and regret. Why had he done it? What way out was there? </b><br/><br/>When I'm reading, I try to clear my mind and focus on what's on the page but sometimes, no matter what I do, my brain refuses to parse the words on the page, and would rather think about anything else. I acknowledge these moments and try my best to deal with them effectively, either by making a plan to solve whatever problem my mind is stuck thinking about, or by putting the book down and doing some journalling to let these thoughts out onto the page and hopefully in doing so keep them from bouncing around in my mind forever.<br/><b><br/>'I think I see Shohobohaum Za in the crowd,' the drone said as they waited at the exit. Ram's entourage was still cluttering the far end of the ribbon of path held clear by the two lines of policemen.<br/><br/>Gurgeh glanced at the machine, then down the line of arm-linked police. He was still tensed from the game, bloodstream suffused with multifarious chemicals. As happened every now and again, everything he saw around him seemed to be part of the game; the way people stood like pieces, grouped according to who could take or affect whom; the way the pattern on the marquee was like a simple grid-area on the board, and the poles like planted power-sources waiting to replenish some exhausted minor piece and supporting a crux-point in the game; the way the people and police stood like the suddenly closed jaws of some nightmarish pincer-movement… all was the game, everything was seen in its light, translated into the combative imagery of its language, evaluated in the context its structure imposed upon the mind. </b><br/><br/>When you're really immersed in a game and playing it more than you probably should, it's common for those same neurons to start firing when you're not playing the game. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect"">Tetris effect</a> is a common example of this.<br/><br/><b> Anyway, he was awash with a bitter-sweet flood of new and enhanced emotions; the terror of risk and possible defeat, the sheer exultation of the gamble that paid off and the campaign which triumphed; the horror of suddenly seeing a weakness in his position which could lose him the game; the surge of relief when nobody else noticed and there was time to plug the gap; the pulse of furious, gloating glee when he saw such a weakness in another's game; and the sheer unbridled joy of victory. </b><br/><br/>Playing games at a high level and trying your best to win can make you feel like a god.<br/><br/><b> Gurgeh saw many cripples.

I haven't told you who I am so far, and I'm not going to tell you now, either. Maybe later.<br/><br/>Maybe.<br/><br/>Does identity matter anyway? I have my doubts. We are what we do, not what we think. Only the interactions count (there is no problem with free will here; that's not incompatible with believing your actions define you). And what is free will anyway? Chance. The random factor. If one is not ultimately predictable, then of course that's all it can be. I get so frustrated with people who can't see this!<br/><br/>Even a human should be able to understand it's obvious.<br/><br/>The result is what matters, not how it's achieved (unless, of course, the process of achieving is itself a series of results). What difference does it make whether a mind's made up of enormous, squidgy, animal cells working at the speed of sound (in air!), or from a glittering nanofoam of reflectors and patterns of holographic coherence, at lightspeed? (Let's not even think about a Mind mind.) Each is a machine, each is an organism, each fulfils the same task.<br/><br/>Just matter, switching energy of one sort or another.<br/><br/>Switches. Memory. The random element that is chance and that is called choice: common denominators, all.<br/><br/>I say again; you is what you done. Dynamic (mis)behaviourism, that's my creed.<br/><br/>Gurgeh? His switches are working funny. He's thinking differently, acting uncharacteristically. He is a different person. He's seen the worst that meatgrinder of a city could provide, and he just took it personally, and took his revenge.<br/><br/>Now he's spaceborne again, head crammed full of Azad rules, his brain adapted and adapting to the swirling, switching patterns of that seductive, encompassing, feral set of rules and possibilities, and being carted through space towards the Empire's most creakily symbolic shrine: Echronedal; the place of the standing wave of flame; the Fire Planet.<br/><br/>But will our hero prevail? Can he possibly prevail? And what would constitute winning, anyway?<br/><br/>How much has the man still got to learn? What will he make of such knowledge? More to the point, what will it make of him?<br/><br/>Wait and see. It'll work itself out, in time.<br/><br/>Take it from there, maestro…<br/><br/></b>",1
