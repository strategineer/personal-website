Very the boys and everything that came before it. Superheroes have been around a very long time and subversive superhero media has been too.<br/>- Reminds me of Martha Wells's Murderbot Diaries in the way the protagonist describes themselves --- Loves watching shows on video streaming services, loves snacks and fast food, loves brands - it feels like a way of catering to a specific market demographic (""Anna is just like me!"") instead of being necessary. - It probably stands out more for me because I'm not in that demographic.<br/>- it's political! - gig economy work sucks, Anna's getting a dream job is interesting but she's still labouring under capitalism... let's see where it goes from there. - Anna's dreamjob is a little twisted and in leading her team she's doing vigilante justice and the heroes vigilantes -> what's going to happen next? Consequences are coming I hope - framing villains as CEOs and small business men and heroes as dangerous vigilantes is fun<br/>- ...<br/>- didn't stick the landing IMO - I was hoping for more than I got - it just wasn't satisfying",1

Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>The Husbands might be the funniest novel I've read...<br/><br/>The debut novel of Holly Gramazio, the script writer for the video game Dicey Dungeons, an author who seems to be steeped in the game space and it shows.<br/><br/><b>Spoilers for the Husbands below:</b><br/><spoiler><br/>The world of The Husbands feels systematically built like a game would be and our main character, Lauren, drunk both literally and on her newfound Husband Gacha powers, reacts to her husband exchanging magic attic as if she were a player in a video game.<br/><br/>Once she's gotten settled into this new magical reality of hers, she begins to poke and prod at the attic to find out how it interacts with the husbands it ""makes"" for her and how it changes the rest of her life outside of her home and husband. Gradually, she figures out how to leverage the attic's power to her advantage, using it to help her find her ideal husband and her ideal self.<br/><br/>Importantly, each husband comes bundled with a multiverse version of reality in which Lauren met and married said husband. Whenever a new husband comes out of the attic Lauren finds herself in a changed world where her job, her relationships and her body are different than the ones she had before.<br/><br/>This attic provides Lauren with the means to play out various ""what ifs"" with these husbands and the other lives attached to each of them.<br/><br/>Eventually, she gets tired of this meaningless rat race-like game she's been playing for far too long, swiping her way through hundreds of husbands.<br/><br/>The meaninglessness Lauren feels is caused by her being the only person in her life who remembers with any kind of permanence what she's been through (and with whom) and with each reset even her capacity to retain the memories of her past lives degrades.<br/><br/>Lauren comes to the realization that her self is constructed and given meaning in large part by the relationships she fosters in her life and by resetting these with every attic-ing she's killing a part of herself and not really living the way she should.<br/><br/>So, Lauren chooses to end this farce and live a real life by burning the attic to the ground --- forcing herself to live out the rest of her days with the last husband the attic produces for her in whatever reasonable version of reality he comes with.<br/><br/>In other words, she puts the controller away and chooses to live her life instead of continuously escaping into others.<br/><br/>The themes of this novel are simple, innoffensive and effectively delivered: escapism is bad, live in the moment, seize the day, etc. We've all heard these imperative statements about how to live a good life a million times, they're understandable but are hard to always live by in practice.<br/><br/>But not every novel has to be the philosophical masterpiece of the century, in the Husbands, Gramazio has gotten her comedy down to a science and that's just as impressive to me, perhaps even more so because of how hard writing a funny book seems to be.<br/><br/>I cannot stress how funny the Husbands is... Watching Gramazio use Lauren as a very likeable mouthpiece to unleash peak British-y, sarcastic and dry humor page after page while having the majority of the jokes land is an experience unlike any other I've had reading a novel in recent memory. <br/><br/>But, the Husbands isn't perfect but its strengths more than make up for it failings.<br/><br/>One of which is the ending which feels a little rushed. It's way too tidy and predictable for my tastes. In the afterword, Gramazio reveals that her first draft had three endings. I interpret this to mean that The Husbands was some sort of limited Choose Your Own Adventure novel initially which might explain why the leadup to the ending felt a little undercooked.<br/><br/>The Husbands feels like a much more lighthearted riff on time loop stories like <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780356502588/"">the First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North</a>. Tonally, it's more in line with something like <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780778307877/"">Cassandra in Reverse by Holly Smale</a> (Hollys rise up!). If you liked any of these books, you'll probably get a kick out of the other two!<br/></spoiler><br/>What can I tell you? British writers fall into two categories: the funny ones and the bigoted sex pests with heinous polital beliefs. Holly Gramazio is really funny and thank God for that. I can't wait to see what she writes next.<br/><br/>So ya, Holly Gramazio's the Husbands might be the funniest novel I've read.<br/><br/>I was actually laughing out loud through it instead of what I usually do with ""funny"" books which is, at best, smile and smirk.<br/><br/>The protagonist and our POV character in the Husbands, Lauren, is very likeable because she's so funny whether we're reading through her dialogue with the husbands she finds herself with or we're reading through her internal monologue-ing throughout the novel.<br/><br/>Lauren's a gamer at heart and a really funny one at that --- truly a woman after my own heart.",1

It's Terry Pratchett's combination of philosophical, political, ethical, cosmological ideas infused into (mostly) lighthearted fantasy romps that makes more unique and interesting stories that are still enjoyable to read more than 30 years later.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780552131063/magic_is_stored_in_the_balls.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""143"" /><br/><br/><blockquote>""He doesn't like wizards and witches much,"" Mort volunteered.<br/><br/>""Nobody likes a smartass,"" she said with some satisfaction. ""We give him trouble, you see. Priests don't, so he likes priests.""<br/><br/>""He's never said,"" said Mort.<br/><br/>""Ah. They're always telling folk how much better it's going to be when they're dead. We tell them it could be pretty good right here if only they'd put their minds to it.""</blockquote><br/><br/>I was interested to see a few possible references to Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series in Mort. I can't confirm if Pratchett was taking the piss out of Le Guin here or he was taking the piss out of some other common predecessor novel/myth.<br/><br/>But here you go.<br/><br/>When the wizard that founded the Unseen University (Discworld's ||| 1 wizard academy), returns to the university 2000 years later and sees the state its in, he says the following: |||<br/><blockquote>'By the Smoking Mirror of Grism, there's going to be a few changes around here!'<br/><br/>Those wizards who had studied history nodded uncomfortably. It would be back to the stone floors and getting up when it was still dark and no alcohol under any circumstances and memorising the true names of everything until the brain squeaked.</blockquote><br/><br/>If you're familiar with Le Guin's Earthsea series, you'll be familiar with this concept of ""true names"". Essentially everything in the Earthsea world has a ""true name"". If you know the ""true name"" of something or something one, this grants you power over the thing with this ""true name"".<br/><br/>Mort is published in 1987, and the first three books of Le Guin's Earthsea are all published prior to 1972 with the first novel in the series, the Wizard of Earthsea, being published as early as 1968. So timeline-wise, it would make sense that Pratchett might be making an explicit reference to Le Guin's Earthsea series here.<br/><br/>This could be just a coincidence. The reason that I don't think it is one, is because earlier in Mort, Pratchett makes another claim about wizards that lines up with how wizards in the Earthsea series are depicted.<br/><br/>[INSERT THE ACTUAL QUOTE FOR THIS WHEN I DO A SECOND READ OF THIS NOVEL...]<br/><br/>At some point, Pratchett comments on the fact that wizards are celibate in Discworld, or something to that effect.<br/><br/>If you've read Le Guin's Earthsea series, you'll know about the way she depicts certain wizards as being voluntarily celibate because they believe that having intimate relations with women will drain their magical powers.<br/><br/>Neither Le Guin's Earthsea series nor Terry Pratchett's Discworld (although I'm not complete on that one), touches on gay wizards, if you're interested in that, please check out <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780756411381"">Mercedes Lackey's The Last Herald-Mage Trilogy</a>.<br/><br/>PS: Remember kids, magic is stored in the balls.",1

They act like a tight knit four man improv group, bouncing off each other really well and provide a great foundation for the humor, action and hijinks in the novel.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780552134620/"">Guards! Guards!***</a> ★★★★<br/>Book 7: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780552152679/"">Thud!***</a> ★★★★★<br/><br/>After reading Thud! and enjoying that, I decided to start reading the entire Discworld City/Night Watch series from the start.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes suffers from a combination of alcoholism and depression leading to his skewed perspective of the world.<br/><br/><blockquote>Lessee . . . he'd gone off after the funeral and got drunk. No, not drunk, another word, ended with ‘er'. Drunker, that was it. Because world all twisted up and wrong, like distorted glass, only came back into focus if you looked at it through bottom of bottle.</blockquote><br/><br/>Carrot is a human who was adopted by dwarven parents and so he's essentially a dwarf in a human body.<br/><br/><blockquote>""Oh, give up!"" he said. ""Are you going to come quietly?"" The mumbling went on. The air began to feel hot and dry. Vimes shrugged. ""That's it, then,"" he said, and turned away. ""Throw the book at him, Carrot."" ""Right, sir."" Vimes remembered too late.<br/><br/>Dwarfs have trouble with metaphors. They also have a very good aim. The Laws and Ordinances of Ankh and Morpork caught the [...] on the forehead. He blinked, staggered, and stepped backwards. It was the longest step he ever took. For one thing, it lasted the rest of his life.</blockquote><br/><br/>Nobby is the everyman, he is very down to earth.<br/><br/><blockquote>It always amazed Vimes how Nobby got along with practically everyone. It must, he'd decided, have something to do with the common denominator. In the entire world of mathematics there could be no denominator as common as Nobby.</blockquote><br/><br/>Sergeant Colon is the boomer of the group.<br/><br/><blockquote>Sergeant Colon owed thirty years of happy marriage to the fact that Mrs Colon worked all day and Sergeant Colon worked all night. They communicated by means of notes. He got her tea ready before he left at night, she left his breakfast nice and hot in the oven in the mornings. They had three grown-up children, all born, Vimes had assumed, as a result of extremely persuasive handwriting.</blockquote><br/><br/>These are the men who've been tasked with keeping the city safe. Conveniently, Ankh-Morpork quickly finds itself under attack by a powerful force and Captain Vimes and his constables (with a LOT of help from the larger than life noblewoman Lady Sybil Ramkin and her stable of swamp dragons) are the only people standing in the way of the total destruction of the city.<br/><br/>Guards! Guards! is not my favorite of Terry Pratchett's work. It's one of his earlier novels in the Discworld universe so he's still figuring things out.<br/><br/>The parts where the POV shifts away from the Night Watch (and Sybil) are not as compelling and could have probably been edited away.<br/><br/>But, everything else is great. The jokes land. The characters are paper thin and yet somehow Terry manages to make them come to life anyway. Their chemistry is off the charts and it's a joy to read.<br/><br/>Of course, Carrot being a dwarf in a human body can be read as him being autistic (one of many examples of autistic representation in Terry Pratchett's work).<br/><br/>He takes things very literally. He's oblivious to social cues. It's pretty on the nose.<br/><br/>I appreciate this depiction because despite him being a caricature, every other character is too. He's never the butt of the joke, his actions might be what cause a comical situation to occur but we're not laughing at him. We're laughing at the situation that Carrot and the other constables find themselves in.<br/><br/>Carrot, unlike the rest of Night Watch, seems to be genuinely happy about being a constable (proven by the letters he regularly writes to his parents back home). He has a positive outlook on life and is happy to be where he is. Over time, his positive outlook rubs off on the other constables, gets them to get off their asses and get to work helping people.<br/><br/>Carrot is oblivious to the fact that when he first comes to Ankh-Morpork, he's essentially working as a bouncer for a whorehouse (he believes that the Lady of the house just has a bunch of unmarried daughters).<br/><br/>Sure, he's different but that's OK. This is one example of many in Terry Pratchett's work of characters who are really out there and different and people around them love them anyway.<br/><br/>The implication, whether that was Terry's intent or not, is that you can be different in your own way and you can be loved too.<br/><br/>The real world isn't as simple as a Terry Pratchett novel. But his work is a constant reminder that there's at least one person on the planet who understood a part of my struggle and accepts me (and people like me) for who I am.<br/><br/>If there's one person like Terry out there, there's got to be more. Even though Terry passed away in 2015, the positive influence of his work continues to spread and I suspect (and I hope) that many people will continue to enjoy his work for many generations to come.<br/><br/>His work deserves it.",1

His work has aged beautifully because the world we live in is as absurd as it's ever been and it's only getting more absurd from here on out.<br/><br/>Small Gods is about an autistic savant (pour a drink every time Terry Pratchett includes an autistic character in one of his Discworld books) named Brutha who is a lowly priest/monk in the church of Om. Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>It turns out that Brutha is the only true believer of Om (everyone else only believes in the rules, the hierarchy, the organisation of the church, everything except the actual deity). And so, when Om finds himself reincarnated as a turtle (because only one person believes in him), he can only communicate with Brutha and no one else.<br/><br/>The unlikely pair form a bond and travel together as Brutha, using his eidetic memory, helps Vorbis, the head of the Quisition, with his plan to conquer the blasphemous Ephebians (Greek-esque philosophers).<br/><br/>Along the way, Brutha and Om meet a bunch of wacky characters with whom they discuss religion and philosophy giving Terry Pratchett ample opportunity to poke fun at both.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Small Gods quite a bit.

There's ample comedy interlaced with impactful action scenes with just a little bit of drama sprinkled in. This time around, it's a little grittier and darker than usual.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780552134620/"">Guards!

A sword is pulled out of a stone or a magic ring is flung into the depths of the sea, and with general rejoicing the world turns.<br/><br/>But this was real life. The world didn't turn, it just went into a spin.</blockquote><br/><br/>Thud! is about prejudice. The main plot as well as every sub plot has something to say about prejudice, how it can cloud our judgement and prevent us from doing the right thing and treating everyone with the respect they deserve.<br/><br/>The choice to have the protagonist be a prototypical white man in a position of power is great because I would have had a hard time taking the novel seriously if Terry Pratchett, a very white man, had chosen to tell this story from the perspective of a minority.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes is an honest man doing the best he can but sometimes that's just not good enough. So, for me, throughout the novel, he flip-flopped between being the hero I was rooting for and the antihero I loved to hate.<br/><br/><b>Minor story spoilers</b><br/><spoiler><br/>An example of this is when Sam Vimes suffers a particularly heinous attack from a few deep dwarves. He feels extremely angry and frustrated about this (rightfully so) but unfortunately he expresses that anger by mistreating other dwarves who had nothing to do with the attack.<br/><br/>This hits home for me because it's something we see time and time again in our own world.<br/><br/>For example, post-911, Muslims around the world suffered from an increase in hate crimes against them. This is a tragedy because the actions of a few extremists (completely divorced from Islam) led to all this hate being directed towards the wrong people. Another more recent example of this was post-COVID, there was a similar increase in hate crimes towards Asian people who, obviously, had nothing to do with COVID, other than suffering because of it like everyone else.<br/><br/>So when Vimes starts getting pissed at dwarves in the same way, it felt real.<br/></spoiler><br/>Thud! is filled with situations like this; touching on issues like discrimination in the workplace, police brutality, racism, etc. that lend a weight to the story that isn't usually present in other Discworld novels.

Now, I was aware of the Culture series and was interested in reading more of it but I never did.<br/><br/>Many many years later, like now, I realized that reading brings me a lot more joy than I thought it did and so now I spend more of my free time reading because I enjoy it so much. I want to read more of Iain Banks's Culture books, so here we are, re-Consider(ing) Phlebas a third time and it's better than ever.<br/><br/>First things first. Who are we considering exactly? In T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land Phlebas is a drowned sailor who, apparently (I don't know I'm not a poet), represents the futility of death and decay.<br/><br/>Appropriately, Consider Phlebas, the Iain Banks novel, is an anti-war anti-narrative satire of science fiction and space opera stories. Consider Phlebas depicts the meaninglessness of war (instead of valorizing it) through the lens of an anti-hero who mostly sucks, is a conspiracy theorist and, perhaps worst of all given the premise of The Culture books, is a humanoid-focused materialist with a distrust and hatred for the AI intelligences that manage a big chunk of the universe.<br/><br/><blockquote>He looked for the Culture ship, then told himself not to be stupid; it was probably still several trillion kilometres away. That was how divorced from the human scale modern warfare had become. You could smash and destroy from unthinkable distances, obliterate planets from beyond their own system and provoke stars into novae from light-years off... and still have no good idea why you were really fighting.</blockquote><br/><br/>It's not usually preachy and yet contains a lot of philosophical ideas that you can spend a lot of time unpacking if you're into that. I rarely re-read books, there's not enough time in the day for that, but there are some books like Consider Phlebas or <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781250781253"">Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun</a> that are so dense that they're begging to be.<br/><br/><blockquote>'Don't you have a religion?' Dorolow asked Horza.<br/><br/>'Yes,' he replied, not taking his eyes away from the screen on the wall above the end of the main mess-room table. 'My survival.'<br/><br/>'So... your religion dies with you. How sad,' Dorolow said, looking back from Horza to the screen. The Changer let the remark pass.<br/><br/>The exchange had started when Dorolow, struck by the beauty of the great Orbital, expressed the belief that even though it was a work of base creatures, no better than humans, it was still a triumphant testimony to the power of God, as God had made Man, and all other souled creatures. Horza had disagreed, genuinely annoyed that the woman could use even something so obviously a testament to the power of intelligence and hard work as an argument for her own system of irrational belief.</blockquote><br/><br/>It has the trappings of the genres it's making fun of; some scenes are played straight so unless you're told beforehand that Consider Phlebas is a satire you might not realize it is one until you're halfway through the book. The overarching theme of the meaninglessness of war permeates throughout the entire text and this makes it hard to ignore the satirical tone.<br/><br/><blockquote>They had flown through the scattered stars without encountering anything out of the ordinary: no messages or signals, no distant flashes from battles, no warp wakes. The area around them seemed calm and undisturbed, as though all that was happening was what always happened: just the stars being born and dying, the galaxy revolving, the holes twisting, the gases swirling. The war, in that hurried silence, in their false rhythm of day and night, seemed like something they had all imagined, an inexplicable nightmare they had somehow shared, even escaped.</blockquote><br/><br/>It's got a little bit of everything in it (even some light romance) but don't be surprised when things go a little awry. It's a grim story but it does have many lighter moments; if you're anything like me you'll find yourself chuckling a lot throughout the text. Iain Banks will set up a joke and he'll pay it off 100 pages later with an extremely delayed punchline.<br/><br/><blockquote>He could see some of the others not far away, to his left and right, pushing and striding through the cane grass and bushes with their rifles held high to one shoulder. They were all gradually getting covered in the dark green moss, which Horza supposed might be useful as camouflage (providing, of course, that it didn't turn out to be some horrible, previously undiscovered sentient killer-moss... He told himself to stop being silly).</blockquote><br/><br/>If you're OK with reading a novel that both deconstructs a genre that you may know and love while also taking the piss, you should consider Consider Phlebas.<br/><br/>This might be the last time I re-re-Consider Phlebas for a while, I'll be quite busy reading the other NINE books in the series.<br/><br/>Auuuuasaauuuuaaauuuhhhhhhhhh",1
