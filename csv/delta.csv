The people must learn how well I govern them. How would they know if we didn't tell them?""</blockquote><br/><br/>It's Dune. It's aged surprisingly well. It has a lot to say about the world of today on the verge of collapse due to the destruction of our climate, poorly thought through technology, rampant late capitalism and the ever enticing venus flytrap of ideology.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780441172719/"">Dune***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780593098233/"">Dune Messiah***</a> ★★★★<br/><br/>Having watched both David Lynch's Dune and Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part One, I feel like although both are interesting and good in their own way (yes, even the David Lynch movie), Dune is a story best told as a novel, by adapting Dune into a movie you lose a lot of what makes Dune interesting.<br/><br/>Maybe if Jodorowsky had been able to achieve his vision of a 15 hour long movie adaptation of Dune, I'd feel differently... but here we are.<br/><br/>What makes Frank Herbert's Dune novel so special for me? Well, it's a few things. The concerns present in the text (environmental, technological, late capitalism-related, ideological) have only become more relevant in the decades since the novel was written.<br/><br/>The novel is by no means perfect and one could argue that Denis Villeneuve's movie is a better and more cohesive ""product"" compared to the novel. But Denis Villeneuve's movie suffers from being a big budget movie that has to condense and drop many of the more interesting parts of the novel and whitewash or completely remove the novel's more subversive ideas.<br/><br/>Another part of the novel that I enjoy quite a bit which isn't present in the movies is Frank Herbert's mastery of the shifting POV. Multiple POV characters is not anything new to me, almost every single novel I read has multiple POV characters. Dune is different because it has an omniscient narrator that dives deep into the psyche of each of the characters it's focusing on, showing the reader their inner thoughts and concerns while also smoothly flowing from one character to the next within the same chapter, even the same paragraph.<br/><br/><blockquote>One thought remained to him. [POV Character 1] saw it in formless light on rays of black: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain.<br/><br/>Silence.<br/><br/>[POV Character 2] stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole behind the table. He had slammed it on a room full of dead men. His senses took in guards swarming around him. Did I breathe it? he asked himself.</blockquote><br/><br/>I'm not too surprised why this is rarely done today. It must be hard to do well and even when done well it's much harder for the reader to follow. It seems as though a lot of readers today, perhaps this has always been true, skim through the texts they read. You can't skim through a text like Dune and expect to understand what's going on at all times because of the constantly switching focus of the omniscient narrator.<br/><br/>Are there any problems with Frank Herbert's Dune? Absolutely. The one issue that stands out to me is the introduction of Feyd-Rautha in the last quarter of the book. Unlike every other character in the novel who is introduced early on and built upon throughout the text, Feyd-Rautha shows up out of nowhere and we're expected to care about his bullshit.<br/><br/>I wonder if this discrepancy comes from Dune's initial publication as a two-part serial? I don't know but it doesn't work for me. Feyd-Rautha should have been introduced way earlier which would have given the reader more time to build the character up in their minds before the final confrontation with him at the end of the novel.<br/><br/>I'm in love with Dune and I'm committed to reading through its sequel Dune Messiah next. If I enjoy that, I'll likely be taking a look at Children of Dune sooner than later.<br/><br/>PS: Special mention to Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son. Reading through Brian's afterword to Dune and his foreword to the sequel Dune Messiah brought me a lot of joy because of how childish, clownish and delusional Brian Herbert seems to be.<br/><br/><blockquote>As if whispering in his own ear, Frank Herbert constantly reminded himself that he was mortal. If he had been a politician, he would have undoubtedly been an honorable one, perhaps even one of our greatest U.S. presidents.</blockquote><br/><br/>Also, Brian Herbert is clearly someone who does not understand what made his father's work resonate so widely and the fact that the ""Dune"" torch was passed down to him is truly sad. What a clown hehe.",1

""You will mark down the ones Chani identifies as Sardaukar and you will have them killed. Do it yourself. I want it done quietly and without undue disturbance. We must keep in mind that there’s more to religion and government than approving treaties and sermons.</blockquote><br/><br/>An inversion of its predecessor Dune, Dune Messiah tells the story of Paul Atreides 12 years later, now sitting on the Imperial throne, post-universe spanning jihad, being responsible for the brutal killings of billions of people... Our ""hero"".<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780441172719/"">Dune***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780593098233/"">Dune Messiah***</a> ★★★★<br/><br/>Paul was never a good, as in doing the right thing, kind of character. In Dune, his mother Jessica, as a Bene Gesserit, puts him on the path to become a manufactured messiah destined to cause the deaths of billions of innocent people. We see him fight against this destiny throughout the text but in the end he succumbs to it, takes the crown of the Padishah Emperor and begins his forceful subjugation of the known universe.<br/><br/>In Dune Messiah, 12 years later he's fulfilled the destiny set out for him by the Bene Gesserit, and it's made much more explicit that despite being a Chosen One (albeit a manufactured one), he's not someone we should look up to or seek to emulate.<br/><br/><blockquote>""I am not on Arrakis,"" she said. ""I'm a passenger on a Guild heighliner in free space.""<br/><br/>""There is no such thing as free space, Madame.""<br/><br/>She read hate mingled with profound suspicion in his tone.<br/><br/>""Muad'dib rules everywhere,"" he said.</blockquote><br/><br/>Being disappointed that some readers read Dune and thought otherwise, Frank Herbert went all the way in the sequel to really hit you on the head with Paul's awfulness.<br/><br/><blockquote>""Ghengis ... Khan? Was he of the Sardaukar, m'Lord?""<br/><br/>""Oh, long before that. He killed ... perhaps four million.""<br/><br/>""He must've had formidable weaponry to kill that many, Sire. Las beams, perhaps, or ...""<br/><br/>""He didn't kill them himself, Stil. He killed the way I kill, by sending out his legions. There's another emperor I want you to note in passing—a Hitler. He killed more than six million. Pretty good for those days.""</blockquote><br/><br/>Frank Herbert is skeptical of the great man theory and his Dune series tackles that seriously. Having been steeped in American politics working as a speech writer for US presidents for many years seems to have given Frank Herbert more than just a little skepticism about ""great"" men.<br/><br/>If you were expecting another Hero's Journey from Dune Messiah (even a mocking portrayal or parody of one) after reading Dune's, expect to be disappointed because Dune Messiah is not that. If Dune was all about Paul Atreides's rise to power, Dune Messiah is about his fall. <br/><br/>Dune Messiah luxuriates in the awfulness of Paul and is expecting you to root for the dissidents that are trying to bring his reign to an end despite them being just as awful as Paul (but much less powerful). I don't think that all people in power should be torn down forcefully from their golden thrones but some definitely should and to see this portrayed in fiction, especially in a novel written so many decades ago, is great.<br/><br/>Other writers would have walked back some of the more subversive themes in Dune after it became such a massive hit to sell more copies instead of double downing on these ideas like he did. And the novel is much more interesting because of it.<br/><br/>Frank Herbert is also skeptical of groups (or perhaps he just likes to write about awful people of all kinds). The Bene Gesserit are an all-women organisation that most of the women in the novel belong to. The Bene Gesserit represent a kind of soft power that control people and influence them through relationships, lineages, genes. They are awful. It's not just that they are partially responsible for Paul's rise to power but at every turn they will surprise you with how low they are willing to go in their game of morality Limbo.<br/><br/><blockquote>The Reverend Mother sighed. On the surface, it was the sigh of a prisoner bemoaning her fate, but inwardly she felt the response as a comment on Irulan. It was futile to hope the Atreides Emperor’s precious gene pattern could be preserved through this instrument. No matter her beauty, this Princess was flawed. Under that veneer of sexual attraction lived a whining shrew more interested in words than in actions. Irulan was still a Bene Gesserit, though, and the Sisterhood reserved certain techniques to use on some of its weaker vessels as insurance that vital instructions would be carried out.<br/><br/>Beneath small talk about a softer pallet, better food, the Reverend Mother brought up her arsenal of persuasion and gave her orders: the brother-sister crossbreeding must be explored. (Irulan almost broke at receiving this command.)</blockquote><br/><br/>Frank Herbert is not a luddite but he is concerned with technology's ability to amplify the worst parts of our humanity. This is clearly a concern of his in Dune; refer to the Butlerian Jihad and his treatment of the ""family atomics"" eg. nuclear weapons. Dune Messiah expands on this theme through the Tleilaxu, who are a people with comparatively advanced technology without any pesky morality getting in the way of their technological ""progress"". <br/><br/><blockquote>This was a Tleilaxu thing. The Tleilaxu displayed a disturbing lack of inhibitions in what they created. Unbridled curiosity might guide their actions. They boasted they could make anything from the proper human raw material—devils or saints. They sold killer-mentats. They’d produced a killer medic, overcoming the Suk inhibitions against the taking of human life to do it. Their wares included willing menials, pliant sex toys for any whim, soldiers, generals, philosophers, even an occasional moralist.</blockquote><br/><br/>Like any good work of sci-fi, Dune Messiah, and the series as a whole so far, is like an onion. Under every layer you'll find more ideas to think about and discuss than you might expect. But if you're anything like me, you might find that most of the concerns Frank Herbert had in the 60s when he wrote these books have only gotten more concerning in the intervening decades and, thus, you might find yourself peeling back this onion that is the Dune series and finding more reasons to cry than you might have expected.",1

Seems like this would be great for one-shots (or potentially longer campaigns) with people with any level of experience in roleplaying because the rules are so simple yet exciting.<br/><br/>Reading through these rules reminded me of two campaigns I participated in.<br/><br/>One campaign set in the Mage: The Ascension setting (sort of, it's complicated, but in our case a setting in which all conspiracies are real and your beliefs alter reality such that they become true, the stronger your beliefs and the more widespread they are the more true and omnipresent they become) where we played a crew of believers of different kinds (a self-help guru, a ghost detective and a The Matrix fanboy) and we unraveled a mystery revolving around a rogue AI (Roko's basilisk) that was trying to take over the world (we nuked it from orbit and travelled the galaxy spreading the power of positive thinking throughout... I think? It's been a while).<br/><br/>Another campaign was inspired by Jojo's Bizarre Adventure where the player characters were all Stand users as well as Cold War-era A-team-esque special forces operatives tasked with infiltrating an evil villain's volcano base and taking it off the map (we nuked it from orbit, are you sensing a pattern here?).<br/><br/>In these two campaigns we used a homebrewed version of the Savage World rules, but the FIST rules seem perfectly designed to play these sorts of cooky slightly superpowered characters in modern-ish settings undercovering global conspiracies and fighting the good (probably not so good if we're being honest, but we're not) fight through violence, subterfuge, theft, cheating and misdirection.<br/><br/>Reading the FIST rules has gotten me so excited to hop back into this kind of setting, I think I'll be working on a one-shot that I can run ASAP.",1
