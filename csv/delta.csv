Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>The Husbands might be the funniest novel I've read...<br/><br/>The debut novel of Holly Gramazio, the script writer for the video game Dicey Dungeons, an author who seems to be steeped in the game space and it shows.<br/><br/><b>Spoilers for the Husbands below:</b><br/><spoiler><br/>The world of The Husbands feels systematically built like a game would be and our main character, Lauren, drunk both literally and on her newfound Husband Gacha powers, reacts to her husband exchanging magic attic as if she were a player in a video game.<br/><br/>Once she's gotten settled into this new magical reality of hers, she begins to poke and prod at the attic to find out how it interacts with the husbands it ""makes"" for her and how it changes the rest of her life outside of her home and husband. Gradually, she figures out how to leverage the attic's power to her advantage, using it to help her find her ideal husband and her ideal self.<br/><br/>Importantly, each husband comes bundled with a multiverse version of reality in which Lauren met and married said husband. Whenever a new husband comes out of the attic Lauren finds herself in a changed world where her job, her relationships and her body are different than the ones she had before.<br/><br/>This attic provides Lauren with the means to play out various ""what ifs"" with these husbands and the other lives attached to each of them.<br/><br/>Eventually, she gets tired of this meaningless rat race-like game she's been playing for far too long, swiping her way through hundreds of husbands.<br/><br/>The meaninglessness Lauren feels is caused by her being the only person in her life who remembers with any kind of permanence what she's been through (and with whom) and with each reset even her capacity to retain the memories of her past lives degrades.<br/><br/>Lauren comes to the realization that her self is constructed and given meaning in large part by the relationships she fosters in her life and by resetting these with every attic-ing she's killing a part of herself and not really living the way she should.<br/><br/>So, Lauren chooses to end this farce and live a real life by burning the attic to the ground --- forcing herself to live out the rest of her days with the last husband the attic produces for her in whatever reasonable version of reality he comes with.<br/><br/>In other words, she puts the controller away and chooses to live her life instead of continuously escaping into others.<br/><br/>The themes of this novel are simple, innoffensive and effectively delivered: escapism is bad, live in the moment, seize the day, etc. We've all heard these imperative statements about how to live a good life a million times, they're understandable but are hard to always live by in practice.<br/><br/>But not every novel has to be the philosophical masterpiece of the century, in the Husbands, Gramazio has gotten her comedy down to a science and that's just as impressive to me, perhaps even more so because of how hard writing a funny book seems to be.<br/><br/>I cannot stress how funny the Husbands is... Watching Gramazio use Lauren as a very likeable mouthpiece to unleash peak British-y, sarcastic and dry humor page after page while having the majority of the jokes land is an experience unlike any other I've had reading a novel in recent memory. <br/><br/>But, the Husbands isn't perfect but its strengths more than make up for it failings.<br/><br/>One of which is the ending which feels a little rushed. It's way too tidy and predictable for my tastes. In the afterword, Gramazio reveals that her first draft had three endings. I interpret this to mean that The Husbands was some sort of limited Choose Your Own Adventure novel initially which might explain why the leadup to the ending felt a little undercooked.<br/><br/>The Husbands feels like a much more lighthearted riff on time loop stories like <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780356502588/"">the First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North</a>. Tonally, it's more in line with something like <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780778307877/"">Cassandra in Reverse by Holly Smale</a> (Hollys rise up!). If you liked any of these books, you'll probably get a kick out of the other two!<br/></spoiler><br/>What can I tell you? British writers fall into two categories: the funny ones and the bigoted sex pests with heinous polital beliefs. Holly Gramazio is really funny and thank God for that. I can't wait to see what she writes next.<br/><br/>So ya, Holly Gramazio's the Husbands might be the funniest novel I've read.<br/><br/>I was actually laughing out loud through it instead of what I usually do with ""funny"" books which is, at best, smile and smirk.<br/><br/>The protagonist and our POV character in the Husbands, Lauren, is very likeable because she's so funny whether we're reading through her dialogue with the husbands she finds herself with or we're reading through her internal monologue-ing throughout the novel.<br/><br/>Lauren's a gamer at heart and a really funny one at that --- truly a woman after my own heart.",1

Chain-Gang All-Stars is NOT one of these kinds of novels. Everything is political but Chain-Gang All-Stars is aggressively so.<br/><br/>The text forces you to think about the topics mentioned above among others, in great detail, and it can be quite depressing. But the premise combined with its execution and the inspirations the text is pulling from act as a lubricant to provide the reader with both a very hard to put down read as well as some deeply upsetting knowledge about how the US oppresses marginalized people.<br/><br/>I was fully immersed in the world presented to me. Adjei-Brenyah's depictions of these dystopian gladiator fights are written such that it's easy to feel like a spectactor in the arena watching these fights from afar, cheering on your favorite contender and cringing when the fight gets bloody.<br/><br/>I felt like I could hear the crowd chanting all around me.<br/><br/><blockquote>Mel—<br/><br/>Her left foot fell first, the midsole landed, and she rolled purposefully to her toes before pushing off again. Her body remembered, would always remember, how to run with purpose.<br/><br/>—an—<br/><br/>Again, her arms reversed themselves, slipping precisely past each other as her right leg rose and fell, her stride opening still. She was very close. She thought of nothing, put her trust in her body as it sped forward.<br/><br/>—cholia<br/><br/>Her arms switchbladed and her legs carried. She continued the push and switch of her arms and legs, forging speed. Her body told her, This speed, me, your body is your weapon.</blockquote><br/><br/>As we get to know the gladiators more personally, what they have to go through to get where they are and why, it becomes harder to read these fights as unproblematic entertainment. It becomes clear that what these fights actually are, which is private capital funded public executions of society's ""undesirables"" for profit.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/ohno.gif"" width=""200"" height=""100"" /><br/><br/>Other than the initial premise, there's a lot to love in Chain-Gang All-Stars, let's talk about it.<br/><br/>Adjei-Brenyah is an expert at perspective shifting. The story is told from the perspective of many different characters and the way the narrative voice shifts between them is masterful. Initially, it's unclear how all of these characters will fit into the larger narrative. Slowly figuring out how they would eventually collide was quite rewarding.<br/><br/><blockquote>We still resting now. I lie down near enough to the others, fall on a bed of grass. The clothes I wear simple but clean. I used one of my murder points to have a brand I never heard of clean my clothes for me each week. Death becomes laundry. Death becomes food. Death the currency of everything if you let it. And they let it. But since it's there I use it and I have a black shirt and pants to train in and sneakers that fit me and socks and underwear that all smell like pine and soap and the sweat of the March.</blockquote><br/><br/>For a book that has so many characters in it, I'm surprised by how many of them I ended up caring about. Wil and Emily were a particular highlight for me; watching this couple live vicariously through the blood sport content they were consuming was a real pleasure.<br/><br/><blockquote>""What the fuck just happened, babe? What the fuck just fucking happened. Oh my fucking God."" Emily had been bingeing recorded streams again. Wil had wanted to be there when she saw this part so she'd watched with him.</blockquote><br/><br/>The novel has an early 2010s young adult framing that I associate with series like The Hunger Games, yet, the characters are all adults and the text is forcing you to come face to face with the grim reality of living as a marginalized person in the United States constantly.<br/><br/>It's a vibe.<br/><br/>And, to be clear, there's little to no escapism to find here if that's what you're looking for.<br/><br/>Despite writing a near future sci-fi text, Adjei-Brenyah keeps the reader grounded in the reality they live in by regularly presenting them with footnotes, contextually revealing real life statistics or stories about the US's prison-industrial complex, sexual violence, etc. I've never seen footnotes used quite like this in any of the fiction I've read, it's unique.<br/><br/><blockquote>There's a bed and a shit tin. Dark in here most of the day. But they glow in my brain. The hole is black. I only see when the door opens. The door opens one time a day. I sit, sleep, sing, flex, breathe, stretch, shake, cough, shit here. Here is where I come apart.[1]<br/><br/>1: Solitary confinement has been consistently found, nationally and internationally, to induce anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, depression, panic attacks, memory loss, and other cognitive defects.</blockquote><br/><br/>Footnotes are also used to provide poetic epitaphs for almost every person who dies. I thought this was a nice touch, giving Adjei-Brenyah the opportunity to pay respects to characters who've been killed and allow him to make these moments more impactful by reminding the reader of who these characters were and who they could have become if their lives weren't cut short.<br/><br/><blockquote>[...] Seen a lot. Done a lot. Found a home in the hell. She never sold poison to kids, but the poison found the kids anyways, so what was the difference? If you don't have a code you have nothing, and [...] had a code. You swing for your family, you hold your head high, you try to do right when you can. She didn't think she was the love type. She was wrong about that. She found it in hell, a home with love and singing.</blockquote><br/><br/>Chain-Gang All-Stars doesn't provide the reader with all the answers they might be craving for by the end. There's story threads that are left unwoven, but it feels like this was done intentionally. An ending that solved every problem presented in the novel would feel cheap and unearned.<br/><br/>There's no easy solution to breaking down systems of oppression but with the right effort applied by the right people we can change the world and make it a better place to live in for all of us.<br/><br/>Chain-Gang All-Stars has got a lot of real depressing stuff in it but it's also a hopeful story that's about doing the best we can given the circumstances we've been forced into, it's about found family, it's about forgiveness and about loving yourself no matter what.<br/><br/><blockquote>""I learned a long time ago. On this one thing you don't negotiate. You love through all the people you've been and hope you have a chance at being better."" [...] ""What I'm telling you is you can curse yourself to the moon and back and what will it have you feeling like? But try to look at yourself and say 'I love you' and see what happens.""</blockquote><br/><br/>It's pretty good y'all.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/bye.gif"" width=""200"" height=""133"" />",1

But Mirabelle's struggles are more topical in the world of today --- where we're obsessed with desires and expectations sold to us by the people in power to grease the wheels of capitalism at the cost of our own health and well-being.<br/><br/>Mona Awad's work seems to be steeped in her own lived experience (or at least she makes it seem that way). Reading Mona Awad's fiction feels like reading creative non-fiction which makes her inevitable swerves into magical realism that much more impactful because her stories feel so grounded in the real.<br/><br/>It just works for me.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked about Rouge was the inclusion of references to Mirabelle's upbringing in Montreal (the city I was born in and have lived around my entire life), the depiction of her French Canadian grandmother and the presence of the French language, usually untranslated, throughout the text. Reading these parts of the novel made me feel ""in the know"" and smart because I happened to grow up in the same city Mona Awad did.<br/><br/>NB: The name Mirabelle is composed of two parts: Mira and Belle. Mira means ""Look"" in Spanish and Belle means ""Beautiful"" in French.<br/><br/>It's a little on the nose all things considered but it always makes me feel smart to recognize the allusions and references being made by authors in their work (this probably explains in large part why I'm so in love with <a href=""https://strategineer.com/authors/gene-wolfe"">Gene Wolfe's work</a>).",1

It's not poetry per-say, it's prose but if all literary writing exists along a scale between poetry and prose then Held's words would fall somewhere in the middle. Each section in Held is so short and so evocative in a way that reminds me of great poetry despite being prose. <br/><br/>Secondly, the structure of novel allows Anne Michaels to ""zoom in"" on specific scenes displaced through time each of which has a lot of room physically on the page and fictionally to breathe and this gives space for the reader to step back and really contemplate them. Each section is dense with emotion in part because how much of both the past preceding it and future is left for the reader to guess at. Anne Michaels leaves a lot of room for the reader to imagine how the characters have come to be where they are now and how they got there. She solidifies parts of this as the novel goes on but doesn't reveal everything.<br/><br/>This makes Held similar to Gilgamesh in that they're both inherently fragmentary. Of course, Held is fragmentary due to Anne Michaels choosing it to be and the Epic of Gilgamesh is because many parts of the story have been lost to time.<br/><br/>In both cases, a lot of room is left on the page leaving the reader's mind open to imagine the connective tissue that would bring all these disparate glimpses into the past together into a cohesive whole. This feels resonant with Held's theme of ancestral legacies rippling through time which I think is really cool!",1

This makes me feel closer to the POV character's thoughts than I would feel otherwise.<br/><br/>Where Samantha Harvey's writing in Orbital differs from Saramago's is in its content. Saramago is tends to make small changes to the way our world works and then works out how those changes ripple out through people's lives on the page for our reading pleasure.s<br/><br/>On the other hand, in Orbital, Samantha Harvey seems more interested in describing the world as-it is (perhaps shifting the timeline forward a bit) and portraying multiple POVs to express the wide range of the human experience.<br/><br/>The hurricane caused by climate change in Orbital feels more like something that's already happening to us today that we're actively suffering from rather than a maneuver Saramago would make like ""everybody on the planet is becoming blind"" as some kind of metaphor for political ideology / faith gone wrong (see Blindness).<br/><br/>In Orbital, Samantha Harvey doesn't appear to be as militantly atheist as Jose Saramago does but the portrayal of Shaun makes me think that she problaby doesn't believe.<br/><br/>I find it hard to believe (see what I did there?) that Shaun, as the only openly religious (Christian to be precise) astronaut on the crew, would go to space, watch as a hurricane rampages on the planet, killing uncountable numbers of people and start to subconsciously and consciously question his faith throughout all of the chapters dedicated to his POV.<br/><br/>That's his main character beat. I found it both hard to believe and a missed opportunity to portray a character who believes in a higher power despite going to space.<br/><br/>One could argue that this new perspective Shaun has on the world could have a profound impact on his belief in God. But given that Orbital presents us with the POVs of six astronauts, I find it a shame that the only openly religious one's only character arc is one of his faith being shaken to the core by the act of going to space.<br/><br/>Using a natural disaster to ""prove"" that an all powerful and benevolent God can't exist is a common argument used in militant atheist spaces. Despite me agreeing with this argument in broad strokes, I find it hard to believe that Shaun wouldn't have encountered it already in his life and built up some kind of religious argument against it.<br/><br/>Basically, I think there's people out there who can believe in God and be astronauts and I would have liked to have seen that on the page even if I'm not a believer myself.",1

Furthermore, though I loved the guild I hated it too — not because of the pain it inflicted on clients who must sometimes have been innocent, and who must often have been punished beyond anything that could be justified by their offences; but because it seemed to me inefficient and ineffectual, serving a power that was not only ineffectual but remote. I do not know how better to express my feelings about it than by saying that I hated it for starving and humiliating me and loved it because it was my home, hated and loved it because it was the exemplar of old things, because it was weak, and because it seemed indestructible.</blockquote><br/><br/>An older Severian, sitting on his throne, starts writing the story of his life and how he came into the position of power he's, presumably, currently in.

Severian doesn't ever do any exposition or go out his way to explain facets of his world that are obvious to him and obvious to the fictional audience he's writing the story for.<br/><br/>Also, Severian is biased, he disguises the truth, he's not always paying attention to what he should be paying attention to and he can't tell the difference between his memories and his dreams.<br/><br/>All of this puts you as the reader in a state of perpetual confusion and forces you to constantly interpret the events, and re-interpret past events, in the novel as you are exposed to more and more contextual information and details revealed by Severian. This framing for the story combined with the far future setting as well Severian's, let's just say unreliability as a narrator, makes for a compelling read.<br/><br/>The meta-ness of it all with Gene Wolfe writing a story about a torturer in a far future for us, the current day, reader, with this torturer writing about himself from his biased and insane perspective for his audience is very compelling.<br/><br/>I could spend hours discussing any randomly chosen paragraph from the first half of the Book of the New Sun. It's dense, multi-faceted and layered unlike anything I've ever read. It's begging to be read multiple times over which I'm already planning to do despite only being halfway through the series as I write this.<br/><br/>The first part of the The Book of the New Sun was published in 1980, way before the era of trigger warnings in novels. If you're sensitive to that, please inform yourself ahead of time before diving into this series because it's grim as hell and contains many events and themes that some people might find uncomfortable (and understandably so).<br/><br/>Barring that, I can recommend this series, or at least what I've read of it so far, to anyone interested in high concept yet grounded sci-fi/fantasy stories.",1

Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>The Extinction of Irena Rey is a novel about translation, transmission, authorship, author worship, media literacy, Mycelium, <i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</i>, Poland, climate change, weebs and everything but the kitchen sink.<br/><br/>I'm amazed by how much spaghetti Jennifer Croft is throwing at the wall in this novel and how much of it sticks. Even when it doesn't work, when the prose is a little too purple, it kind of still works just in a different way because of the framing of the story.<br/><br/>The Extinction of Irena Rey by Jennifer Croft is a frame story (<a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780575069015/"">I can't get enough of them</a>) in which a woman named Alexis Archer has translated a text (peppering it with extensive footnotes) written by, in their mother tongue, and told from the perspective of one of her fellow translators.<br/><br/>This text, also named The Extinction of Irena Rey, is a personal account of the events that transpired between the author, Alexis Archer, and Irena Rey's six other translators, most of whom have known each other for over a decade, who've travelled to Poland to translate Irena Rey's latest work.<br/><br/>Of course, hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>Jennifer Croft plays with this framing in interesting ways and that's what makes this novel special. I enjoyed slowly nibbling away at it while trying to integrate all the disparate ideas in the text into a cohesive whole. Getting to know the translators and how they fit into the bigger picture was enjoyable even though some of them really suck.<br/><br/>I don't tend to like mystery novels much. The Extinction of Irena Rey is the first mystery novel I've enjoyed without any caveats. The mystery that begins to reveal itself as you read the text is not constantly thrown in your face which I appreciated.<br/><br/>Instead, the mystery is the kettle on the stove all these translators are swimming in and butting heads in. The mystery isn't being used as a carrot on a stick to keep the reader artificially engaged with the story <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781473223851/"">like in some novels</a>.<br/><br/>The mystery is the story and the story is the mystery and everything surrounding it fits nicely together and enhances the rest of the story in a meaningful way.<br/><br/><b>Spoilers for a mystery-related beat halfway through the novel:</b><br/><spoiler><br/>Around midway through the novel, after the initial setup and reveal of the core mystery, one of the translators, Freddie starts an uncharacteristic Detective Poirot-esque monologue where he lists out all the information and clues that the translators have gathered so far and he mentions possible further avenues for their investigation to take.<br/><br/>Considering the tone of the speech and Freddie being the one giving it, I interpret this as a shot being taken by Jennifer Croft at that style of mystery novel and signaling to the reader that she's trying to do something different.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>The Agathie Christie-esque mystery novel is still very popular and it's been copied more times than we can count, seemingly by many authors who don't seem to understand how to bring that genre forth into the modern day in a compelling way.<br/><br/>And, I think that Croft really is doing something different with the mystery in the Extinction of Irena Rey that hits way harder for me than other mystery novels I've read.<br/></spoiler><br/>This novel is begging to be thought about during and after reading it and I love that about it.<br/><br/>It's not perfect though, I would have preferred fewer paragraphs where Croft uses her characters to speak directly to the reader about her thoughts on translation.<br/><br/>These felt a little redundant and sometimes out of place especially because my beliefs about the art of translation seem to be aligned with Croft's as presented within the text through the character of Alexis Archer.<br/><br/>A great translation must by necessity transform the text it's based on to be great and this requires the translator to be just as much of a writer as the original author, if not more.<br/><br/>One cannot know about translators like Margaret Jull Costa especially known for her work translating most of <a href=""https://strategineer.com/authors/josé-saramago/"">José Saramago's work into English</a>, a Herculean task I wouldn't wish upon my greatest enemy, and continue to make reductive claims about a translator's work being lesser than a writer's work because, well, translators are writers.<br/><br/>What elevates The Extinction of Irena Rey to a 5/5 for me and allows me to fully enjoy it for what it is despite the minor quibbles I have with it --- is how big of a swing it's taking, how absolutely weird it is and how Croft manages to stick the landing anyway.<br/><br/>I'll be keeping an eye Jennifer Croft's work moving forward --- she's at least convinced me that I should be paying attention to her.<br/><br/>Now all I've got to do now is figure out how I'm going to deal with all this spaghetti Croft has thrown all around my reading nook.<br/><br/>Slurp Slurp.<br/><br/>Slurp Slurp.<br/><br/>The metafictional swing of The Extinction of Irena Rey piqued my interest and my expectations were more than met. Turns out that a story translated by a translator told from the POV of another translator with both characters directly involved in the story being told is exactly the kind of premise I'm really into.<br/><br/>In the Extinction of Irena Rey, Jennifer Croft puts a lot of big ideas onto the page for the reader to think about. This seems to be common practice in the more ""artsy"" novels I've read. But I was pleasantly surprised by both how interested I was in most of the themes found within the novel and how cohesively woven together they seemed to be.",1

Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>Another novel to put on the list where we have a bunch of smaller sections within larger paragraphs acting as scene transitions and POV switches.<br/><br/>Most of these sections are bookended with the usual leading statement that writers end chapters with but these are written so well here and are so densely packed that it gives the whole novel an easy to read, brisk pace.<br/><br/>NB: Held also does this to some extent with a focus on shorter sections and less leading statements.<br/><br/>This trend makes sense to me in the world of shrinking attention spans we live in. It's excruciatingly hard to get the average person (man?) to pick up a book when our brains have been trained by our phones to crave the constant dripfeed of dopamine provided by a like or an exploding pinata of loot.<br/><br/>I expect to see more and more books written this way to cater to this growing demographic of people. This isn't bad per-say just a prediction.<br/><br/>I didn't know anything about the Ministry of Time before picking it up and reading it other than it being in contention for the Best Novel of 2024 in certain circles (at least that's what I had understood prior to picking it up).<br/><br/>I ""get"" it. It's an ambitious novel that succeeds at combining multiple genres that usually don't mix in a way that <i>really</i> works.<br/><br/>Kaliane Bradley's The Ministry of Time is something like three parts romance, one part thriller, one part history fiction and one part science fiction. At its heart, its a romance. There's the constant longing and desire expressed by the protagonist and the ""will they won't they"" throughline that is used to prop up all the other genre tropes Bradley is masterfully juggling.<br/><br/>What surprised me most about The Ministry of Time was the tone. It's vulgar, it's funny, it's sarcastic all ways that feel natural to me but I don't often see in the novels I read.<br/><br/>Kaliane Bradley, and the narrator in The Ministry of Time, is a ""passing"" mixed race person raised by an immigrant mother displaced from her country and her people. This is relevant to my experience of reading through the novel because it comes up a lot in the text and because this is also my lived experience.<br/><br/>I can't say that Bradley's portrayal of this sexy AF sailor plucked straight from the Victorian era speaks to me but there's a lot in the Ministry of Time that does. And, it seems obvious to me that is partially because Bradley, the narrator and I all share this common history and how important it is to our understanding who we are, where we belong and how we interact with the world.<br/><br/>It's good, it's entertaining and I feel comfortable boosting the signal of the Ministry of Time in my own little way because of how well it portrays a lived experience of mine that I've never been able to put into words. Seeing parts of that lived experience expressed in this work that's doing so many other impressive warms my heart.<br/><br/>Although, I wonder what Bradley's next novel will look like considering that she's obviously self-inserted parts of herself (in a very fan fiction-y way) into the text, as the narrator. What will her next protagonist look like?<br/><br/><b>Spoilers for the book below</b><br/><br/>The romance-ness of the text...<br/><br/>The sex scenes are pretty explicit (a bit less so than in The Extinction of Irena Rey though).",1

'She had me dressed up in a suit, toting a gun and shooting at toy missiles which ""explosively dismantled"" themselves.'<br/><br/>'You didn't enjoy it.'<br/><br/>'Not at all. I had high hopes for that girl, but too much of that sort of nonsense and I think her intelligence will explosively dismantle.'<br/><br/>'Well, such diversions aren't for everybody. She was just trying to be helpful. You'd said you were feeling restless, looking for something new.'<br/><br/>'Well, that wasn't it,' Gurgeh said, and felt suddenly, inexplicably, saddened.<br/></blockquote><br/>Gurgeh has studied and played all the games that exist and none no one can provide him with a challenge. He's sad because he's bored. The Culture might be a post-scarcity society but that doesn't mean that they've completely eliminated unhappiness, they've just reduced its likelihood.<br/><br/><blockquote> 'All reality is a game. Physics at its most fundamental, the very fabric of our universe, results directly from the interaction of certain fairly simple rules, and chance; the same description may be applied to the best, most elegant and both intellectually and aesthetically satisfying games. By being unknowable, by resulting from events which, at the sub-atomic level, cannot be fully predicted, the future remains malleable, and retains the possibility of change, the hope of coming to prevail; victory, to use an unfashionable word. In this, the future is a game; time is one of the rules. Generally, all the best mechanistic games - those which can be played in any sense ""perfectly"", such as grid, Prallian scope, 'nkraytle, chess, Farnic dimensions - can be traced to civilisations lacking a relativistic view of the universe (let alone the reality). They are also, I might add, invariably pre-machine sentience societies.<br/><br/>'The very first-rank games acknowledge the element of chance, even if they rightly restrict raw luck. To attempt to construct a game on any other lines, no matter how complicated and subtle the rules are, and regardless of the scale and differentiation of the playing volume and the variety of the powers and attributes of the pieces, is inevitably to shackle oneself to a conspectus which is not merely socially but techno-philosophically lagging several ages behind our own. As a historical exercise it might have some value. As a work of the intellect, it's just a waste of time. If you want to make something old-fashioned, why not build a wooden sailing boat, or a steam engine? They're just as complicated and demanding as a mechanistic game, and you'll keep fit at the same time.' </blockquote><br/><br/>Gurgeh reciting his past work on games, specifically talking about his preference for games with luck in them because they more accurately reflect the world we live in. If we're to believe that the games we play reflect on the societies we live in and vice-versa, games without luck are bad because that's not how the real world works and it never will. Playing and thinking about games like that will teach us the wrong lessons about the world we live in.<br/><br/><blockquote> The game went on. People came and went around him. The web held all his fortune; the little spheres, holding their secret treasures and threats, became like discrete parcels of life and death, single points of probability which could be guessed at but never known until they were challenged, opened, looked at. All reality seemed to hinge on those infinitesimal bundles of meaning. </blockquote><br/><br/>There are times when the game we're playing, the fiction we're reading or any kind of abstraction of the real world we're immersing ourself in, becomes more important than anything else.<br/><br/><blockquote> Three days passed. He couldn't settle to anything. He tried to read papers, old books, the material of his own he'd been working on - but on every occasion he found himself reading and re-reading the same piece or page or screen, time and time again, trying hard to take it in but finding his thoughts constantly veering away from the words and diagrams and illustrations in front of him, refusing to absorb anything, going back time and time again to the same treadmill, the same looping, tail-swallowing, eternally pointless round of questioning and regret. Why had he done it? What way out was there? </blockquote><br/><br/>When I'm reading, I try to clear my mind and focus on what's on the page but sometimes, no matter what I do, my brain refuses to parse the words on the page, and would rather think about anything else. I acknowledge these moments and try my best to deal with them effectively, either by making a plan to solve whatever problem my mind is stuck thinking about, or by putting the book down and doing some journalling to let these thoughts out onto the page and hopefully in doing so keep them from bouncing around in my mind forever.<br/><blockquote><br/>'I think I see Shohobohaum Za in the crowd,' the drone said as they waited at the exit. Ram's entourage was still cluttering the far end of the ribbon of path held clear by the two lines of policemen.<br/><br/>Gurgeh glanced at the machine, then down the line of arm-linked police. He was still tensed from the game, bloodstream suffused with multifarious chemicals. As happened every now and again, everything he saw around him seemed to be part of the game; the way people stood like pieces, grouped according to who could take or affect whom; the way the pattern on the marquee was like a simple grid-area on the board, and the poles like planted power-sources waiting to replenish some exhausted minor piece and supporting a crux-point in the game; the way the people and police stood like the suddenly closed jaws of some nightmarish pincer-movement… all was the game, everything was seen in its light, translated into the combative imagery of its language, evaluated in the context its structure imposed upon the mind. </blockquote><br/><br/>When you're really immersed in a game and playing it more than you probably should, it's common for those same neurons to start firing when you're not playing the game. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect"">Tetris effect</a> is a common example of this.<br/><br/><blockquote> Anyway, he was awash with a bitter-sweet flood of new and enhanced emotions; the terror of risk and possible defeat, the sheer exultation of the gamble that paid off and the campaign which triumphed; the horror of suddenly seeing a weakness in his position which could lose him the game; the surge of relief when nobody else noticed and there was time to plug the gap; the pulse of furious, gloating glee when he saw such a weakness in another's game; and the sheer unbridled joy of victory. </blockquote><br/><br/>Playing games at a high level and trying your best to win can make you feel like a god.<br/><br/><blockquote> Gurgeh saw many cripples. They sat on street corners, selling trinkets, playing music on scratchy, squeaky instruments, or just begging. Some were blind, some had no arms, some had no legs. Gurgeh looked at the damaged people and felt dizzy; the gritty surface of the street beneath him seemed to tip and heave. For a moment it was as though the city, the planet, the whole Empire swirled around him in a frantic spinning tangle of nightmare shapes; a constellation of suffering and anguish, an infernal dance of agony and mutilation. </blockquote><br/><br/>Ah yes. Living in America, <b>an infernal dance of agony and mutilation</b>.<br/><br/><blockquote> 'Good,' Hamin nodded. 'You see, Gurgeh, one can be on either side in the Empire. One can be the player, or one can be… played upon.' Hamin smiled at what was a play on words in Eächic, and to some extent in Marain too. </blockquote><br/><br/>Everything is a game, or at least can be thought of as a game. Life is a game, an unfair one sadly, and every aspect of it can be thought of as a game. There's a set of rules defined by the physical world around us and the societies we live in. You can't choose to NOT play the game, and if you do you're likely to get played yourself.<br/><br/>If you start off in a privileged position and you can use the rules to your advantage, you're winning. Otherwise, you might not be.<br/><br/>We're all _Morat_, The Player of Games in our own lives. And, I think that's part of why this book is so good. We're all gamers.<br/><br/><blockquote> Gurgeh watched Groasnachek as it fell away beneath them. The city tilted as he was thrown back into his seat; the whole view swung and juddered as the shuttlecraft powered into the hazy skies.<br/><br/>Gradually all the patterns and the shapes came out, revealed for a while before the increasing distance, the city's own vapours, dust and grime, and the altering angle of their climb took it all away.<br/><br/>For all the jumble, it looked momentarily peaceful and ordered in its parts. The distance made its individual, local confusions and dislocations disappear, and from a certain height, where little ever dallied, and almost everything just passed through, it looked exactly like a great, mindless, spreading organism. </blockquote><br/><br/>Iain Banks's ability to write fantastic prose, bring up interesting philosophical conundrums without being preachy about his own beliefs AND tell stories that hook you and never let go, all within the same novel consistently amazes me.<br/><blockquote><br/>So far so average. Our game-player's lucked out again. I guess you can see he's a changed man, though. These humans! I'm going to be consistent, however. I haven't told you who I am so far, and I'm not going to tell you now, either. Maybe later.<br/><br/>Maybe.<br/><br/>Does identity matter anyway? I have my doubts. We are what we do, not what we think. Only the interactions count (there is no problem with free will here; that's not incompatible with believing your actions define you). And what is free will anyway? Chance. The random factor. If one is not ultimately predictable, then of course that's all it can be. I get so frustrated with people who can't see this!<br/><br/>Even a human should be able to understand it's obvious.<br/><br/>The result is what matters, not how it's achieved (unless, of course, the process of achieving is itself a series of results). What difference does it make whether a mind's made up of enormous, squidgy, animal cells working at the speed of sound (in air!), or from a glittering nanofoam of reflectors and patterns of holographic coherence, at lightspeed? (Let's not even think about a Mind mind.) Each is a machine, each is an organism, each fulfils the same task.<br/><br/>Just matter, switching energy of one sort or another.<br/><br/>Switches. Memory. The random element that is chance and that is called choice: common denominators, all.<br/><br/>I say again; you is what you done. Dynamic (mis)behaviourism, that's my creed.<br/><br/>Gurgeh? His switches are working funny. He's thinking differently, acting uncharacteristically. He is a different person. He's seen the worst that meatgrinder of a city could provide, and he just took it personally, and took his revenge.<br/><br/>Now he's spaceborne again, head crammed full of Azad rules, his brain adapted and adapting to the swirling, switching patterns of that seductive, encompassing, feral set of rules and possibilities, and being carted through space towards the Empire's most creakily symbolic shrine: Echronedal; the place of the standing wave of flame; the Fire Planet.<br/><br/>But will our hero prevail? Can he possibly prevail? And what would constitute winning, anyway?<br/><br/>How much has the man still got to learn? What will he make of such knowledge? More to the point, what will it make of him?<br/><br/>Wait and see. It'll work itself out, in time.<br/><br/>Take it from there, maestro…<br/><br/></blockquote>",1
