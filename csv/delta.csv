Like the orogenes, I'm also desperately trying to find moments of happiness in a world that is broken beyond repair (aren't we all?).<br/><br/>I'm different, like the orogenes, I'm different in a way that constantly puts me at odds with the vast majority of people on this planet (they don't think like me, they don't communicate like me and they usually don't care to try to understand me and my perspective).<br/><br/>I'm constantly bending over backwards to meet their expectations and most people can barely lift a finger to try and meet me somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>Sometimes I wonder why I keep trying to change myself, to be less different, to be more like everybody else and less like myself to fit in. Because I know deep down that no matter what I do, I will never be accepted as I am, warts and all.<br/><br/>Like one orogene in particular, sometimes I feel as though it would be best for us to shatter the world we live in and start over.<br/><br/>The Fifth Season is one of the best novels I've ever read. N. K. Jemisin is skilled beyond her years. She's written an engaging text that kept me glued to my seat throughout but also a text that holds up to scrutiny and begs you to think about what it's trying to say about our own world.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a light read, maybe look elsewhere.

Once again, she manages to create a fantasy world where violence doesn't solve everything.

Think of that sometimes.""</b><br/><br/>Hanging out with a friend or a loved one is one of the greatest things a human can do and yet how often do we see this honestly portrayed in fantasy? Yet, The Other Wind is the most ""fantasy"" fantasy book in the Earthsea series, featuring many tropes that you may have seen before (tropes: <spoiler>a restoration narrative, a mage haunted by his dark past, a king's romance with a princess from another land, a conflict occurring on the edges of the known world, etc. </spoiler>) yet subverts or manages to make each of these tropes more interesting and grounded in reality than they would otherwise be if written by a less competent author.<br/><br/><b>""Maybe your gift will come back to you, when what must happen has happened. I cannot promise that. I will try to restore what I can of what I take from you. But we're all walking in the night, now, on ground we don't know. When the day comes we may know where we are, or we may not. [...]""</b><br/><br/>As a conclusion to the Earthsea series, it succeeds in many ways. What I love about it most is how well Le Guin manages to do perspective shifting between the different POV characters, some new and some returning from previous books in the series.<br/><br/>In doing so, Le Guin manages to show us the characters we've been following through their journeys so far, where they're at now and where they're going as well as giving us the most comprehensive view on the inner workings of the world of Earthsea we've gotten in the series so far. It's rare for a final book in a series to hit as hard as the first, The Other Wind got pretty close for me.<br/><br/><b>So, here in the center where earth's powers met, the human powers had also met together: a king, a princess, the masters of wizardry.</b><br/><br/><b>And the dragons. And a priestess-thief turned farmwife, and a village sorcerer with a broken heart...</b><br/><br/>It's a great conclusion to the series. Now that I've read the whole series I can confirm with certainty that the third book, The Farthest Shore, is not worth reading, unless you're a super fan who needs to know just how bad it is. The Other Wind feels like Le Guin's rerun of The Farthest Shore in more ways than one. Thankfully, The Other Wind succeeds where The Farthest Shore does not.",1

They act like a tight knit four man improv group, bouncing off each other really well and provide a great foundation for the humor, action and hijinks in the novel.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-13/"">Guards! Guards!***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 7: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-12/"">Thud!***</a> ★★★★★<br/><br/>After reading Thud! and enjoying that, I decided to start reading the entire Discworld City/Night Watch series from the start.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes suffers from a combination of alcoholism and depression leading to his skewed perspective of the world.<br/><br/><b>Lessee . . . he'd gone off after the funeral and got drunk. No, not drunk, another word, ended with ‘er'. Drunker, that was it. Because world all twisted up and wrong, like distorted glass, only came back into focus if you looked at it through bottom of bottle.</b><br/><br/>Carrot is a human who was adopted by dwarven parents and so he's essentially a dwarf in a human body.<br/><br/><b>""Oh, give up!"" he said. ""Are you going to come quietly?"" The mumbling went on. The air began to feel hot and dry. Vimes shrugged. ""That's it, then,"" he said, and turned away. ""Throw the book at him, Carrot."" ""Right, sir."" Vimes remembered too late.</b><br/><br/><b>Dwarfs have trouble with metaphors. They also have a very good aim. The Laws and Ordinances of Ankh and Morpork caught the [...] on the forehead. He blinked, staggered, and stepped backwards. It was the longest step he ever took. For one thing, it lasted the rest of his life.</b><br/><br/>Nobby is the everyman, he is very down to earth.<br/><br/><b>It always amazed Vimes how Nobby got along with practically everyone. It must, he'd decided, have something to do with the common denominator. In the entire world of mathematics there could be no denominator as common as Nobby.</b><br/><br/>Sergeant Colon is the boomer of the group.<br/><br/><b>Sergeant Colon owed thirty years of happy marriage to the fact that Mrs Colon worked all day and Sergeant Colon worked all night. They communicated by means of notes. He got her tea ready before he left at night, she left his breakfast nice and hot in the oven in the mornings. They had three grown-up children, all born, Vimes had assumed, as a result of extremely persuasive handwriting.</b><br/><br/>These are the men who've been tasked with keeping the city safe. Conveniently, Ankh-Morpork quickly finds itself under attack by a powerful force and Captain Vimes and his constables (with a LOT of help from the larger than life noblewoman Lady Sybil Ramkin and her stable of swamp dragons) are the only people standing in the way of the total destruction of the city.<br/><br/>Guards! Guards! is not my favorite of Terry Pratchett's work. It's one of his earlier novels in the Discworld universe so he's still figuring things out.<br/><br/>The parts where the POV shifts away from the Night Watch (and Sybil) are not as compelling and could have probably been edited away.<br/><br/>But, everything else is great. The jokes land. The characters are paper thin and yet somehow Terry manages to make them come to life anyway. Their chemistry is off the charts and it's a joy to read.<br/><br/>Of course, Carrot being a dwarf in a human body can be read as him being autistic (one of many examples of autistic representation in Terry Pratchett's work).<br/><br/>He takes things very literally. He's oblivious to social cues. It's pretty on the nose.<br/><br/>I appreciate this depiction because despite him being a caricature, every other character is too. He's never the butt of the joke, his actions might be what cause a comical situation to occur but we're not laughing at him. We're laughing at the situation that Carrot and the other constables find themselves in.<br/><br/>Carrot, unlike the rest of Night Watch, seems to be genuinely happy about being a constable (proven by the letters he regularly writes to his parents back home). He has a positive outlook on life and is happy to be where he is. Over time, his positive outlook rubs off on the other constables, gets them to get off their asses and get to work helping people.<br/><br/>Carrot is oblivious to the fact that when he first comes to Ankh-Morpork, he's essentially working as a bouncer for a whorehouse (he believes that the Lady of the house just has a bunch of unmarried daughters).<br/><br/>Sure, he's different but that's OK. This is one example of many in Terry Pratchett's work of characters who are really out there and different and people around them love them anyway.<br/><br/>The implication, whether that was Terry's intent or not, is that you can be different in your own way and you can be loved too.<br/><br/>The real world isn't as simple as a Terry Pratchett novel. But his work is a constant reminder that there's at least one person on the planet who understood a part of my struggle and accepts me (and people like me) for who I am.<br/><br/>If there's one person like Terry out there, there's got to be more. Even though Terry passed away in 2015, the positive influence of his work continues to spread and I suspect (and I hope) that many people will continue to enjoy his work for many generations to come.<br/><br/>His work deserves it.",1

The upcoming anniversary of the thousands years old Battle of Koom Valley is keeping tension high between the dwarves and the trolls; making it harder for the constables of the Watch to keep the peace and solve the crime.<br/><br/>Thud! is a Terry Pratchett novel through and through. There's ample comedy interlaced with impactful action scenes with just a little bit of drama sprinkled in. This time around, it's a little grittier and darker than usual.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-13/"">Guards! Guards!***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 7: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-12/"">Thud!***</a> ★★★★★<br/><br/><b>It would be a lot simpler [...] if this was a story. A sword is pulled out of a stone or a magic ring is flung into the depths of the sea, and with general rejoicing the world turns.</b><br/><br/><b>But this was real life. The world didn't turn, it just went into a spin.</b><br/><br/>Thud! is about prejudice. The main plot as well as every sub plot has something to say about prejudice, how it can cloud our judgement and prevent us from doing the right thing and treating everyone with the respect they deserve.<br/><br/>The choice to have the protagonist be a prototypical white man in a position of power is great because I would have had a hard time taking the novel seriously if Terry Pratchett, a very white man, had chosen to tell this story from the perspective of a minority.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes is an honest man doing the best he can but sometimes that's just not good enough. So, for me, throughout the novel, he flip-flopped between being the hero I was rooting for and the antihero I loved to hate.<br/><br/><b>Minor story spoilers</b><br/><spoiler><br/>An example of this is when Sam Vimes suffers a particularly heinous attack from a few deep dwarves. He feels extremely angry and frustrated about this (rightfully so) but unfortunately he expresses that anger by mistreating other dwarves who had nothing to do with the attack.<br/><br/>This hits home for me because it's something we see time and time again in our own world.<br/><br/>For example, post-911, Muslims around the world suffered from an increase in hate crimes against them. This is a tragedy because the actions of a few extremists (completely divorced from Islam) led to all this hate being directed towards the wrong people. Another more recent example of this was post-COVID, there was a similar increase in hate crimes towards Asian people who, obviously, had nothing to do with COVID, other than suffering because of it like everyone else.<br/><br/>So when Vimes starts getting pissed at dwarves in the same way, it felt real.<br/></spoiler><br/>Thud! is filled with situations like this; touching on issues like discrimination in the workplace, police brutality, racism, etc. that lend a weight to the story that isn't usually present in other Discworld novels. I'm really into it!<br/><br/>Thud! was published right after Going Postal (which is my favorite Discworld novel I've read so far) and they seem to share quite a bit of DNA. With Going Postal dealing with capitalism, toxic corporate culture, bureaucracy (and more!) instead of the topics covered in Thud!.<br/><br/>If you like Going Postal, you might like Thud! (and vice-versa). I love both tremendously.<br/><br/>As of right now, Thud! has taken my second favorite Terry Pratchett novel slot; bumping Thief of Time down to a respectable third place.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with Terry Pratchett. He's just so consistently good at what he does, and I love his work because of it.",1

You have to constantly give reasons to explain why they don't just kill everybody and achieve their evil goals. More than either of the two previous books, I had to shut my brain off and just enjoy the ride no matter how implausible the plot felt at times.<br/>- Giving minor characters their own POV chapters brought a lot of life into them. Making the world feel a little more interesting and less centered around the larger than life main characters. Unfortunately all these characters are eventually killed off, which ends up feeling a little cheap.<br/>- Kell is a bit of a boring character. He doesn't really have an arc or change at all from the start of the story all the way through to the end. That said, most characters in this series are pretty stable in terms of their goals and beliefs throughout the story but at least they're a bit more interesting than Kell.<br/>- The side story where most of the main characters escape from the city in search of the MacGuffin feels like filler. Also, I hate MacGuffins.<br/>- A bunch of characters bite their lip and I don't think that's an actual thing people do (other than in Twilight).

A torturer? You may leave the guild, you know, if you prefer.""</b><br/><br/><b>I told him firmly -- and as though I were slightly shocked by the suggestion -- that I had never considered it. It was a lie. I had known, as all the apprentices knew, that one was not firmly and finally a member of the guild until one consented as an adult to the connection. Furthermore, though I loved the guild I hated it too -- not because of the pain it inflicted on clients who must sometimes have been innocent, and who must often have been punished beyond anything that could be justified by their offences; but because it seemed to me inefficient and ineffectual, serving a power that was not only ineffectual but remote. I do not know how better to express my feelings about it than by saying that I hated it for starving and humiliating me and loved it because it was my home, hated and loved it because it was the exemplar of old things, because it was weak, and because it seemed indestructible.</b><br/><br/>An older Severian, sitting on his throne, starts writing the story of his life and how he came into the position of power he's, presumably, currently in. The story begins as a coming of age story with Severian describing his youth as a journeyman in the Torturer's Guild. Eventually, he leaves the Tower he has called home for his entire life and embarks on an adventure becoming an executioner for hire where he roams around, kills people for the state, meets a diverse cast of characters and discovers the, absolutely wild, world he lives in.<br/><br/>Gene Wolfe is known for writing stories from the perspective of characters deeply embedded in the narrative. His Book of the New Sun is no exception. Severian doesn't ever do any exposition or go out his way to explain facets of his world that are obvious to him and obvious to the fictional audience he's writing the story for.<br/><br/>Also, Severian is biased, he disguises the truth, he's not always paying attention to what he should be paying attention to and he can't tell the difference between his memories and his dreams.<br/><br/>All of this puts you as the reader in a state of perpetual confusion and forces you to constantly interpret the events, and re-interpret past events, in the novel as you are exposed to more and more contextual information and details revealed by Severian. This framing for the story combined with the far future setting as well Severian's, let's just say unreliability as a narrator, makes for a compelling read.<br/><br/>The meta-ness of it all with Gene Wolfe writing a story about a torturer in a far future for us, the current day, reader, with this torturer writing about himself from his biased and insane perspective for his audience is very compelling.<br/><br/>I could spend hours discussing any randomly chosen paragraph from the first half of the Book of the New Sun. It's dense, multi-faceted and layered unlike anything I've ever read. It's begging to be read multiple times over which I'm already planning to do despite only being halfway through the series as I write this.<br/><br/>The first part of the The Book of the New Sun was published in 1980, way before the era of trigger warnings in novels. If you're sensitive to that, please inform yourself ahead of time before diving into this series because it's grim as hell and contains many events and themes that some people might find uncomfortable (and understandably so).<br/><br/>Barring that, I can recommend this series, or at least what I've read of it so far, to anyone interested in high concept yet grounded sci-fi/fantasy stories.",1

These stories provide interesting context for the series, how it came about and where it might have gone if Le Guin had had time to write more stories in the world of Earthsea.<br/><br/>A Description of Earthsea is a dry loredump-esque text describing various parts of Earthsea listed out without the context and the characters necessary to ground this knowledge and make it interesting. It feels like a writer's exercise and not something meant to be read by readers.<br/><br/>The two first short stories were written by Le Guin before she wrote the first Earthsea book, both of these are interesting in that they contain familiar yet distinct ideas which Le Guin would build on and refine in Earthsea.<br/><br/>The essay she wrote after writing Tehanu gives some context on how Le Guin felt about the series as a whole, her thoughts on fantasy, the heroic mode and its problematic yet intimate ties with masculinity and gender. She discusses how, with Tehanu, she tried to break some of these assumptions and genre tropes that are inherently mysoginistic which she believed to have replicated in the first three books in the Earthsea series.<br/><br/>The last two stories seemed to have been written after she wrote the final published book in the series. One being quite disconnected from the rest of the Earthsea stories we've read so far but interesting in its own way.

They're incomplete but I'm posting them here mostly un-edited (just some typo fixes) for posterity. They're either too incomplete, too snarky, too snooty or too mean-spirited to post on Goodreads.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-29/"">A Memory Called Empire</a> ★★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-11/"">A Desolation Called Peace***</a> ★<br/><br/>My ideal review would be very short, just focus on my complaints (the book was probably rushed to the printing press due to the unexpected acclaim received by the previous book and suffers from poor editing/polish especially in the middle of the text because of this) without giving any examples.<br/><br/>KISS<br/><br/>Cool but the way the aliens are dealt with is wack<br/>- nine hibiscus dunking her hands into the alien corpse<br/>- her asking if it's a mammal, bro what does it matter if it's breasts secrete milk<br/><br/>""Hello""<br/><br/>Putting her hands together, Sixty-Nine Apache Attack Helicopter spoke with a treble in her voice betraying her allegiance with the Three Dongers; a semi-secret branch of the military subservient not to the Empire but to the Ministry of War.<br/><br/>What could this mean? Does she know about my allegiance with Darhat Manjeenonopupu?<br/><br/>Oh. I wish Three Seagrass was here to help me understand what I should do? Oh but we fought a few hours ago for no reason, but I wish we hadn't, but we fought, but I wish we hadn't. I'm a barbarian, I will never be Texcatalllananlanztim. I'll always be an outsider.<br/><br/>Wahhhhhhhhh wahhhhhhh.<br/><br/>""Uhhh are you ok, Mahit?""<br/><br/>Oh no. I haven't said anything in five minutes, because I've been stuck here in an interminable internal monologue that nobody wants to read. God help me...<br/><br/>Heavy sigh.<br/><br/>This book is OK. I think with more time in the oven and some heavy editing it could have been fantastic.<br/><br/>As-is it was really challenging to get through. In particular, the way aliens are handled is heinous.<br/><br/>I almost threw the book across the room when Nine Hibiscus, a military leader in charge of thousands of soldiers, dunked her unprotected hands into the corpse of an unknown alien species.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on when the first question she asks to the medical examiner is the following: ""Are they mammals?""<br/><br/>Nine Hibiscus, please, these aliens seem to have access to technology that may greatly surpass your own. They annihilated hordes of your empire's military like they were ants.<br/><br/>I don't think it's relevant to ask if the alien being in front of you secretes milk out of its breasts.<br/><br/>I've been poisoned by reading Adrian Tchaikovsky's depiction of aliens in his Children of Time series and his The Final Architecture series.<br/><br/>It's done so well in these novels and comparing those depictions with what we get here makes A Desolation Called Peace look real bad.<br/><br/>I'm frustrated and I'm not sure reading more of this book will help with that.<br/><br/>Reading through more of this book, I don't think Arkady Martine knows what a mammal is or how arbitrary of a distinction it is in the context of her story.<br/><br/>Her characters definitely don't. I cannot believe that the mammal fixation is brought up a second time.<br/><br/>If they're mammals we'll be able to speak with them? Ehhhhhhhhhh<br/><br/>A rushed sequel for a book that greatly surpassed expectations and achieved massive critical success.<br/><br/>The constant inconsistencies, the atrocious way the aliens are handled and described is unbelievably bad, the characters's internal monologues going on and on about nothing relevant.<br/><br/>All of this is exhausting. I enjoyed the previous book in the series despite having a few gripes with it but this one is not a great follow up.<br/><br/>I think it succeeds in some ways. Now that the reader is more familiar with the universe, Martine feels comfortable writing the sequel from multiple POVs, in doing so gives herself the opportunity to give us a better sampling of the world.<br/><br/>Does she succeed fully with this? No. The POVs aren't different enough from one another.<br/><br/>But the book feels forced in a way I haven't seen in a novel in a long time. The author starts off with a message about the book being for/by outsiders. But it's not, it tries to be but it's super forced and is coming not from within the story but from without.<br/><br/>Is this a cynical attempt to capture a particular audience? Maybe? I think it's more likely that Martine doesn't understand that good sci fi comes from imagining worlds that are different from our own and seeing how those differences change things and what it might mean for us.<br/><br/>Instead Martine seems to believe that good sci fi is about creating an interesting world and then moving characters from point A to B while they constantly have temper tantrums, eternally question themselves and their skills and fend off assassination attempts.<br/><br/>Every sentence spoken by a character is followed by interminable internal monologuing. Clearly writing like this comes naturally to Martine and sometimes it works but it's too much here.<br/><br/>It's excruciating to read and completely understand someone DNFing this book midway through.<br/><br/>This novel needed more time in the oven and it would have been way better.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a tad satirical. Don't take me too seriously but please do think twice about reading this novel, even if you really enjoyed the previous one. You might be disappointed like I was.<br/><br/>Here's a few reasons why you might give A Desolation Called Peace by Arkady Martine a 5 star review.<br/>- It won the Hugo award for best novel, just like the previous book in the series. Other people seem to like it, I guess I should like it too?<br/>- Both books in the series combined come out to about 1 thousand pages. After spending that much time with a series, it must be good because otherwise look at all this time I've wasted (Sunk Cost Fallacy)<br/>- I really loved A Memory Called Empire, I guess I like the sequel too?<br/><br/>I respect your point of view even if you disagree with mine. But it's so confusing to me, seeing so many people give this novel a perfect score and gush about it, while completely neglecting the aspects of it that are objectively bad.<br/><br/>This novel feels extremely rushed, it likely was rushed out the door by the publisher so that they could most efficiently capitalize on the unexpected acclaim received by the first book. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel after all.<br/><br/>NB: We do live under capitalism. It is what it is.<br/><br/>All the signs of a rushed release are there if you look closely.<br/>1. Awkward run-on sentences are everywhere and cause the reader psychic damage trying to get through them.<br/><br/>Read the following excerpt out loud to see what I mean:<br/><br/><b>The water she'd drunk made her able to talk [author's note: this sentence is atrocious]. Even sing one of the absurd pitched-consonant words that they'd picked up from the aliens in demonstration for the yaotlek, though Mahit was so much better at making those noises that Three Seagrass had begun to plan a scheme in which she taught her how to have some halfway-decent breath and pitch control, pass on the lessons she'd had as a crèche-kid in how to project from the diaphragm when orating.</b><br/><br/>Reading this novel closely, you can and will find many sentences just like this peppered all throughout the text and reading them will drive you insane.<br/><br/>I hate this kind of writing. I don't know where it comes from. It goes against everything I know about good writing. It drives me up the wall.<br/><br/>NB: If you're like me, I highly recommend you also stay away from Ann Leckie's The Raven Tower which suffers from the same kind of long winded writing.<br/>2. The novel has multiple POV characters and their narratorial voices are way too similar and this will encourage you to start drinking, heavily.<br/><br/>Each bit of dialogue, no matter which character's POV we're following, is interspersed with an ungodly amount of stream of consciousness blahblahblah text that is really annoying to read.<br/><br/>If one character was written like this, it's all good. This narration style would define the character and make them unique, and it wouldn't be so overbearing.<br/><br/>The problem is that every single POV character is written like this because I guess that's how Arkady Martine writes and her editor was not given the time and support they needed this time to take out the trash.<br/><br/>Let's look at some examples: <b>Mahit said, ""Well, that's unexpectedly pleasant, all considered,"" and didn't go on any further. She didn't want to--she couldn't tell Three Seagrass that she was here to spy on the war for Darj Tarats, in order to escape Aknel Amnardbat's surgeons. To do worse things for Darj Tarats, if there was an opportunity. She couldn't. So she got into the shuttle instead, settling amongst the supply crates and strapping herself into some freefall-control webbing. There were similar webbings on all of the walls, the floor, the ceiling. It was an efficie""t, well-designed ship. It must make a hundred of these short hops in a month-- ""Quite,"" said Three Seagrass, all edges, interest and wariness and a sort of invitation deferred: We can play, Mahit, even if we don't play just now, if playing's what you want.</b><br/><br/>Notice that Arkady Martine explicitly cuts off Mahit's stream of consciousness narration here.<br/><br/>This paragraph is actually cool because there's an intentionality to it. The reader is meant to understand that Mahit is someone who is often stuck in her own head. That's awesome characterization.<br/><br/>The issue is that this narrative voice bleeds into every other character's POV.<br/><br/>For example, in this excerpt, Nine Hibiscus has just been informed by a subordinate that the alien's planet has been found.<br/><br/><b>""If we can get there without them seeing us,"" Nine Hibiscus said. The scatterbombs would do exactly what Eighteen Chisel was imagining. They would, yes, blow anyone out of their sky. And then they'd poison that sky, and the planets below it. The scatterbombs were deathrain. A last resort. Almost never used where people lived-- because after them, people didn't live there anymore. She'd only used a scatterbomb barrage once, and that had been against another ship, safe in the blackness of space. The idea of using them on the aliens was-- She liked it too much, was what. Liked it too much, too fast. Such a simple solution. So much easier than the rest of the situation she'd been detailing for herself.</b><br/><br/>Huuuuuuuhhhh. Does this sound familiar? If you replace the names in these excerpts, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.<br/><br/>Notice how frequently Arkady Martine uses the ""--"" (em dash) to cut off her character's neverending internal monologues.<br/><br/>You might be wondering, how did I find these examples? Did I carefully sift truth the entire book for the perfect example to present a skewed representation of the book to make my argument more convincing?<br/><br/>No, I opened my book at a random page and found relevant examples each time because the book is filled with them.<br/>3. Final thoughts because reading this book makes me not want to think anymore.<br/><br/>Reading through A Desolation Called Peace has driven me to the brink of insanity and so I find myself ready and able to talk shit about any part of it.<br/>- Arkady Martine's ignorance about biology and linguistics and her decision to hinge her entire novel on these topics that she clearly knows less than nothing about is infuriating.<br/>- Her fixation on the fact that these aliens are mammals (well sort of, wink wink) and how apparently that ISN'T a completely arbitrary distinction to make is wild. If these aliens secret milk out of their breasts, have vertebra and shit, it is not plot critical, please do not fixate on their mammalness.<br/>- Don't get me started on the title of the novel. Cynically, I understand the sequel of a popular book should probably use a similar naming scheme to the first novel to make it clear that it's a sequel and in doing so sell more copies. But, come on, A Desolation Called Peace, is real dumb.<br/><br/>I feel betrayed by the Goodreads and the science fiction community at large for promoting the apparent perfection of this novel.<br/><br/>Although, there are some heroes out there (you know who you are) who knew the truth and tried their best to communicate it, mostly falling on deaf ears.<br/><br/>I should have listened. Maybe then I wouldn't be headed straight for the mental asylum.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a little satirical, please be chill<br/><br/>NB: p. 404, O face due to great diplomacy by Mahit<br/><br/>I've written more than three thousand words between five different first drafts trying to explain exactly why reading A Desolation Called Peace made me so angry. Instead of fumbling with my words, I'll let Ursula K. Le Guin speak for me (quote taken from her essay The Stalin in the Soul).<br/><br/><b>Reading is not a passive reaction, but an action, involving the mind, the emotions, and the will. To accept trashy books because they are ""best-sellers"" is the same thing as accepting adulterated food, ill-made machines, corrupt government, and military and corporative tyranny, and praising them, and calling them the American Way of Life or the American Dream. It is a betrayal of reality. Every betrayal, every lie accepted, leads to the next betrayal and the next lie.</b><br/><br/>Suffice to say that I feel <b>betrayed</b>.<br/><br/>It's clear to me from reading this book closely, that it was rushed to the printing press in an attempt to capitalize on the unexpected (but mostly deserved) acclaim received by the previous book in the series, A Memory Called Empire. With a bit more time in the oven, the sequel could have been fantastic, and yet here we are.<br/><br/>Open the book on any page, put your finger anywhere to find:<br/>- Omnipresent awkward run-on sentences that are begging to be trimmed by a competent editor.<br/>- Multiple POV characters who all suffer from the same never ending stream of consciousness narrative voice that is a pain to read.<br/>- Some absolutely baffling ignorance about aliens, linguistics, the definition of the word ""spy"" and basic biology.<br/><br/>I've rated the book 1 star although it's probably deserving of more (maybe a 2 or a 3), but I need to fight the good fight and do my part to pull this book back into the void where it belongs.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed A Desolation Called Peace, great! Maybe you even rated it 5 stars? Fantastic. I'm truly glad you enjoyed it.<br/><br/>But are you sure that you're really being honest with yourself?<br/><br/>If you don't want to hear what I have to say, fine, but at least listen to Chad Le Guin. If we continue to accept slop like this, praise its greatness, and put it on a pedestal, publishers have no incentive to give authors and editors the time they need to do their best work.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm wrong? Maybe this is really one of the best sci-fi novels of our generation? Maybe the author and the editor and everyone involved got all the time they needed to make A Desolation Called Peace the best it could be.<br/><br/>Well then, if A Desolation Called Peace is the peak of what modern sci-fi can bring to the table, I don't want to read it anymore.",1

To no one's surprise, Adrian Tchaikovsky is responsible.<br/><br/>Eyes of the Void clicked for me when I realized that Adrian Tchaikovsky is an avid tabletop roleplayer and this novel comes alive because he's basically role-playing (to perfection) all of his characters.<br/><br/>He's thought about (and nailed) the way each character thinks and speaks based on where they're from, who they are, their culture, etc. He's great at this and you can see this in all of his work but The Final Architecture series feels built for him to flex his ability to write great characters.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-16/"">Shards Of Earth</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-05/"">Eyes Of The Void*</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 3: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/1800-01-29/"">Lords Of Uncreation</a> currently reading...<br/><br/>Another strength of Adrian Tchaikovsky's work is his ability to interweave his world building into the plot as well as the characters in such a way that it all feels meaningful.<br/><br/>He excels at showing instead of telling. When Haever, our favorite spy/neo-noir detective, is having a stressful conversation with his boss, we're told that he has an implant that detected an increase in stress in him and automatically injected him with his heart medication.<br/><br/>This detail serves to set the scene but it also gives us an idea of the level of technology that humans have access to in this universe. This is but one example but the novel is filled with details like this that are pulling their weight by simultaneously fleshing the characters as well as the world they live in.",1

This one isn't bad per say but I didn't like it as much. The story is told out of order and that's usually a hard sell for me (although I did appreciate being told when/where the chapters were taking place in the timeline).<br/><br/>Children of Memory fell a little flat for me because I prefer novels that don't withhold information from the reader to inject mystery and intrigue into a story instead of just telling an interesting story in the first place. Children of Memory feels more like an M. Night. Shyamalan movie this time around.<br/></spoiler><br/>||| More spoilers ahead |||<br/><spoiler><br/><br/>Withholding a bit of information is fine as long as the story being told holds up on its own without the reader knowing about the ""twist"". There's a few chapters that feel pretty miserable to read because they're sort of remixes of previous chapters (the child POV also didn't really help with this). At times it felt like Adrian was padding out the page count instead of trying to tell an interesting story.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed reading through Children of Memory. I applaud it for being a little avant garde in terms of how the story is told but I'm not sure that it completely sticks the landing.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the series or you're interested in unpacking some of the philosophical questions raised by the book, I can recommend it.<br/><br/><b>""You don't think what they have here, their culture, their traditions, is worth preserving?""
