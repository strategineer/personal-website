Here you go.<br/><br/>Employee: ...<br/><br/><b>Now, you have created a little social opening, by breaking the norms and</b> <b>going off script, and making a little joke. [...] You've given the employee an</b> <b>opportunity to recognize your sense of play and humor and react with a</b> <b>response of his own. You thereby give him a chance to break out of his role</b> <b>and express his individuality in response. If he takes up your offering in the</b> <b>right way, then the result is a kind of mutual appreciation of individuality.[^2]</b><br/><br/>It all boils down to this:<br/><br/><b>Sucking is a matter of failing to take up social openings; not sucking is a</b> <b>matter of taking them up and engaging; and being awesome is a matter of</b> <b>creating them.[^3]</b><br/><br/>Philosophy is the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality and existence. On Being Awesome does not seek to give you answers about the meaning of life or the existence of God.<br/><br/>It tries, and succeeds, to give you an understanding of what being awesome (or sucky) is. In doing so, it provides you with the means of becoming a more awesome version of yourself and surrounding yourself with awesome people.<br/><br/>[^1]: Riggle, Nick.

As the third and final(ish) book in the series I was expecting something a little bit more. Or maybe I was expecting a little bit less, a more tightly edited and polished story. Either would have been nice.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-12/"">A Darker Shade Of Magic</a> ★★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-18/"">A Gathering Of Shadows*</a> ★★★★<br/>Book 3: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-18/"">A Conjuring Of Light**</a> ★★★<br/><spoiler><br/>Here's some thoughts:<br/>- It's difficult to tell a story about an antagonistic character who is basically a god. You have to constantly give reasons to explain why they don't just kill everybody and achieve their evil goals. More than either of the two previous books, I had to shut my brain off and just enjoy the ride no matter how implausible the plot felt at times.<br/>- Giving minor characters their own POV chapters brought a lot of life into them. Making the world feel a little more interesting and less centered around the larger than life main characters. Unfortunately all these characters are eventually killed off, which ends up feeling a little cheap.<br/>- Kell is a bit of a boring character. He doesn't really have an arc or change at all from the start of the story all the way through to the end. That said, most characters in this series are pretty stable in terms of their goals and beliefs throughout the story but at least they're a bit more interesting than Kell.<br/>- The side story where most of the main characters escape from the city in search of the MacGuffin feels like filler. Also, I hate MacGuffins.<br/>- A bunch of characters bite their lip and I don't think that's an actual thing people do (other than in Twilight). Please correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the time I spent with the book (and the series as a whole) but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was a little shorter.<br/><br/></spoiler>",1

Drawing from thousands of media research studies, author W. James Potter explores key components to understanding the fascinating world of mass media. Potter presents examples and facts to help you understand how the media operate, how they attract attention, and how they influence you and the public.<br/><br/>A must read, don't sit on this one!<br/><br/>Learn about Media Literacy, especially if you're name is Louis (I swear to God).<br/><br/>Here's some random quotes from the book that I highlighted for whatever reason:<br/><br/><b>[...] while choice is attractive, too much choice can paralyze us into</b> <b>inaction. When we feel overwhelmed, we rely more and more on automatic</b> <b>routines, and leads us into a deeper and deeper rut of doing the same things</b> <b>over and over.</b><br/><br/>That moment when you stare at the hundreds (thousands?) of games in your Steam Library and proclaim: ""I don't know what to play"" or ""I guess I'll just play (insert predatory MOBA or CCG here)"".<br/><br/><b>The reason faulty beliefs are such a dangerous trap is because they are</b> <b>self-reinforcing.</b><br/><br/>cough cough Flat Earthers cough cough Anti Vaxxers cough cough<br/><br/><b>The mass media construct audiences so they can rent those audiences out to</b> <b>advertisers. In constructing those audiences, the media focus on particular</b> <b>niches where they can provide content that serves a need not already being</b> <b>met. They attract particular kinds of people into those audiences then</b> <b>condition them for repeat exposures.</b><br/><br/>If you take a step back and really think about what the porn industry has been able to do in the last 15 years or so, it's bananas. How many kids have grown up with instant access to an infinite sea of porn accessible anywhere and at any time? A lot. How many of them have been seriously harmed psychologically by this? At least one.<br/><br/><b>Successful websites, whether they deal with information, entertainment,</b> <b>music, video, or the printed word, all try to do the same thing.
