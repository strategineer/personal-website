I think that you could do something similar using Anathem in an intro to philosophy class because of how densely packed it is with philosophy, logic and rhetoric.<br/><br/>Knowing the premise of Anathem ahead of time, I was prepared for it to be as dry and boring as it could possibly be.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Anathem's narrative is way more compelling than I was expecting it to be. Anathem isn't just a book filled to the brim with interesting ideas it's also packed with world-spanning journeys and potentially world ending (or creating) scenarios.<br/><br/>What's not to love? <br/><br/>I love a good long-ass book (see Gene Wolfe's the Wizard Knight, Mary Gentle's Ash: a Secret History and Stephen King's Under the Dome). Reading something in the first chapter and having it pay off hundreds of pages later, there's nothing quite like it.",1
9780062694591,2024/07/25,2star fantasy read unowned,read,1,2,"A grounded yet fantastical story about a young woman, Sasha, who is selected to attend the Institute of Special Technologies. Sasha attends this mysterious college and is thrust into a world of dark academia with widespread and fantastical implications.<br/><br/><blockquote>“Attention, students,” continued Portnov just as softly. “You are at the beginning of a journey, during which all of your strength will be required. Physical and mental. What we will be studying is not for everyone. Not everyone can handle what this does to a person. You have been carefully selected, and you all have what it takes to make that journey successfully. Our science does not tolerate weakness and takes cruel revenge on laziness, on cowardice, and on the most infinitesimal attempt to avoid learning the entire curriculum. Is that understood?”</blockquote><br/><br/><b>Minor spoilers to follow</b><br/><br/>I blasted my way through this novel, I would be lying if I didn't mention that it pulled me in with compelling mysteries and fantastic mind bending depictions of a character who's mind is bending in ways it shouldn't.<br/><br/><blockquote>She detonated herself like a grenade, ran all over in a stream, and enveloped the entire auditorium in a thin fog. A split second, and the fog thickened and charged at [...], storming into his nostrils, pouring into his throat, catching the foreign breath.<br/><br/>A scent of cologne flashed. It became dark.<br/><br/>One more second. Sasha lay crumpled like a wet rug. In heavy drops she poured onto the wooden floor, flowed into the wide cracks between the planks, collected into a puddle. A new second: Sasha lay limp, her clothes soaked through, gelatinous like a jellyfish, without a single muscle, without a single thought. The unseasonably warm February sun beat into the windows of the brightly lit auditorium 14.</blockquote><br/><br/>Unfortunately this novel loves setting up mysteries but doesn't know how to unravel them in a satisfying way. The mysteries and the way they were handled were part of why I was so enraptured by the story but the mysteries eventually, especially through the process of being revealed, lost their luster and lessened my appreciation for everything that happened leading up to the reveals. <br/><br/>Marina and Sergey Dyachenko seem to love flaunting the fact that most of the explanations behind these mysteries are being withheld from Sasha (and the reader) for seemingly no reason, other than to act as a carrot on the stick for the reader to follow, over and over again. Here are just a few examples:<br/><br/><blockquote>“Because you never explained to us what we are being taught, let alone why!”<br/><br/>“You would not be able to understand it. It’s too early.”</blockquote><br/><br/>...<br/><br/><blockquote>“Too early, my girl. It’s too soon for you to know. Right now you are still a slave of a framework, a plaster mold with a hint of imagination. With memory, with a personality . . </blockquote><br/><br/>...<br/><br/><blockquote>“That thing that was there . . . What is it?”<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>“That, Alexandra, is too early for you to know. No need. I promise you, though—you will. You will find out during your exam.”</blockquote><br/><br/>This book has some interesting ideas, I just wish they were laid out in a different way and paid off eventually.<br/><br/>The idea of an exclusive college teaching students secret knowledge about the world is a really compelling premise and I can see why this premise is so popular. But the terrible wrapping up of the mysteries and the incomprehensible ending has thrown me for such a loop that I feel myself actively resisting thinking about this book as anything else other than a missed opportunity that isn't worth thinking too much about.",0

Very the boys and everything that came before it. Superheroes have been around a very long time and subversive superhero media has been too.<br/>- Reminds me of Martha Wells's Murderbot Diaries in the way the protagonist describes themselves --- Loves watching shows on video streaming services, loves snacks and fast food, loves brands - it feels like a way of catering to a specific market demographic (""Anna is just like me!"") instead of being necessary. - It probably stands out more for me because I'm not in that demographic.<br/>- it's political! - gig economy work sucks, Anna's getting a dream job is interesting but she's still labouring under capitalism... let's see where it goes from there. - Anna's dreamjob is a little twisted and in leading her team she's doing vigilante justice and the heroes vigilantes -> what's going to happen next?

Grunts is a satire of the schlocky high fantasy Tolkien ripoffs of the 70s and 80s. It pokes fun at the aesthetic of the American military as portrayed in film and literature. It combines Grand Guignol (think slapstick but extra gory and violent) dark comedy with satire on bad fantasy.<br/><br/>The story begins with a group of orcs, the Agaku led by the orc Ashnak, tasked with stealing powerful yet non-magical weapons from a dragon's hoard by the nameless necromancer. The pretense for this quest is that these weapons will be useful for the Final Battle between the forces of Light and Dark that's about to happen.<br/><br/>These weapons turn out to be an impressive assortment of modern military equipment: assault rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, tanks, helicopters, surface to air missile launchers...<br/><br/>You name it, they've got it.<br/><br/>The Agaku are your stereotypical generic fantasy orcs: a little stupid, violent, strong. The dragon's hoard of modern military weaponry was cursed with a geas which changes the mindset of the orcs into the stereotypical Vietnam War United States Marine Corps soldier mindset: huuuuuurrah-ing, tabbaco chewing, cigar smoking, a belief that might makes right, etc.<br/><br/>Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/><b>Minor Spoilers Ahead</b><br/><br/>It turns out that the modern military equipment the orc marines have access to isn't enough to turn the tide of the Final Battle. The forces of Light win but many of the forces of Dark, including Ashnak and his orc marines, manage to escape. The orc marines return to their fort in Nin-Edin.<br/><br/>In the following weeks, the forces of Light chase down and ethnically cleanse (we'll get into it) the remaining forces of Dark. This leads to a siege (take a shot every time Mary Gentle depicts a siege in her work) where Ashnak and his orc marines have dug into their fort at Nin-Edin and are preparing to fend off the forces of Light.<br/><br/>Note that all this happens in the first third of the novel, subverting the trope of the not so final Final Battle.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Let's talk about the forces of Light. Epic fantasy has always had a problematic relationship with presenting good/bad in black and white terms with little room in between. My understanding is that this simplicity appeals to the human desire to constantly simplify the eternally complex real world in order to live within it.<br/><br/>That's fine. But by presenting good/bad like this, it's easy to fall into the trap (intentionally or not) of depicting certain beings as inherently evil. <br/><br/>Dehumanizing the human.<br/><br/>Mary Gentle portrays the forces of Light and Dark....<br/><br/>posits that the weapons we have access to change us (power corrupts), she posits that power is power and war is war,<br/><br/>... fantasy satire with grit. Think Terry Pratchett but more mature and with a lot more gore and violence.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>themes to explore: ethnic cleansing, rnd orc with gold eyes (1/8th elven)<br/><br/>Kicking off the book with the ""nameless necromancer"" completely wasted on wine, sending off one of his orc captains on a quest of some sort was a great way to start.<br/><br/>I think this is going to be a goldmine for fantasy roleplaying ideas...<br/><br/><blockquote> ""Ned and Will Brandiman,"" Ned introduced. ""Notorious 'alflings. Sir and madam, you are looking at two of the greatest professionals it will ever be your good fortune to meet. As to what we do, we find lost property.""<br/><br/>Shazgurim snorted. ""And is it usually lost before you two 'find' it?""<br/><br/>""Now that you come to mention it…""<br/><br/>Ashnak nodded his great tusked head. ""Thieves. Our master the nameless said there would be thieves.""<br/><br/>""We prefer the term adventurers. It sounds so much more respectable."" Will brushed himself down and strolled across the dip to look at the ransacked chests. ""You realise it will be necessary to return the tools of our trade? And, now I come to think about it, we have no transport. I think it would probably be advisable for you to detail one of your warriors to carry these chests for us."" </blockquote>",0

Things quickly go wrong and everyone who's left on the planet is stuck dealing with the consequences of their actions. Our protagonist Renata Ghali in particular is suffering through her existence on the planet and trying to come to terms with her role during Planetfall and the years that followed. <br/><br/>A lot of callbacks to the Planetfall event (when the colonists initially landed on the surface of the planet) without revealing the events specifically. This withholding of critical knowledge is the carrot on the stick that's being used to pull you to the end of the novel but this sort of storytelling is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. It is ""explained"" by the narrator's trauma related to these events but explaining a storytelling device in-universe is not good enough for me to enjoy it. <br/><br/>Other than that, I'm in love with this novel and world. The depiction of someone suffering from a trauma induced hoarding issue is compelling. I've never seen a hoarder depicted in fiction before and I think it's done well here. Having to live with someone with a hoarding issue is something I've experienced and it's nice to see an author attempt, and mostly succeed, at depicting it well from the perspective of the hoarder.<br/><br/>The alien life is alien but the revellation of what it really is and what it's doing is not delivered to the reader in a satisfying way. It's a little too slow and I don't care about it all that much. Knowing what it is lessens my interest in it.",0

A very Kingian novel, like with many King novels, it's a banger with some caveats to be aware of.<br/><br/>Despite the boring premise, Stephen King sucks the reader into the world with real feeling depictions of life, parenthood and kids haunted by their ominous premonitions of the future. Cujo is a banger as long as you're willing to put with King's many idiosyncrasies.<br/><br/>The constant explicit descriptions of human (and dog) bodily functions such as <spoiler> pissing, farting, shitting, vomiting, ejaculating </spoiler> may bother some. King's caricatural depictions of overweight and/or low-income white people might bother others.<br/><br/>But if you're a fan of King's work, this shouldn't be unexpected but I've never read a King novel with this much ""going for the gross out"" moments. It's so egregious that it feels like he's parodying himself at certain points (see the mailman's POV for evidence of this).<br/><br/>Cujo reminds me of 9780340992586 but is a tighter, more focused version of that. I like Under the Dome more because the bigger scope and science fiction-al bent to that story is more up my alley. <br/><br/>Despite all that, it's really surprising to me (but perhaps not so surprising considering how mainstream and popular Stephen King was at his peak) how good King, nominally a white man, is at telling stories from the point-of-view of kids and women.<br/><br/>Specifically in Cujo, Charity and Donna's chapters are great. Both of these women are mothers to young boys, in relationships with abusive and workaholic men, respectively, and their struggles they find themselves in and their attempts to get out of them alive and well are depicted in really compelling and real ways. None of this moments with these characters feel cheap, they feel earned.<br/><br/>It's no secret that King was raised by his mother and that his father just left them at some point, never to return. And, it seems like that could have had an impact on King, perhaps allowing him to more easily empathise with and tell stories from these perpectives like the his mother's which would have so unlike his own.",1

I think it should have stayed that way. This book is similar to something like the F.A.T.A.L. RPG in that it's an artifact produced by an older cishet white male tabletop roleplaying community which seems to have a very particular idea of what tabletop roleplaying is and should be --- by writing extensively about their thoughts on the subject, they reveal the extent of their morally bankrupt ideology for everyone to see.<br/><br/>Here's a quote from the section titled ""Pretty Woman"" --- keep in mind, this is just the tip of the iceberg:<br/><br/><blockquote>Indeed, sexy women make the world go round. Without going overboard, pepper your campaign with exquisite curves, creamy thighs, and delicate ruby-red mouths. Seduce the players with her physical attractiveness.

Does she know about my allegiance with Darhat Manjeenonopupu?<br/><br/>Oh. I wish Three Seagrass was here to help me understand what I should do? Oh but we fought a few hours ago for no reason, but I wish we hadn't, but we fought, but I wish we hadn't. I'm a barbarian, I will never be Texcatalllananlanztim. I'll always be an outsider.<br/><br/>Wahhhhhhhhh wahhhhhhh.<br/><br/>""Uhhh are you ok, Mahit?""<br/><br/>Oh no. I haven't said anything in five minutes, because I've been stuck here in an interminable internal monologue that nobody wants to read. God help me...<br/><br/>Heavy sigh.<br/><br/>This book is OK. I think with more time in the oven and some heavy editing it could have been fantastic.<br/><br/>As-is it was really challenging to get through. In particular, the way aliens are handled is heinous.<br/><br/>I almost threw the book across the room when Nine Hibiscus, a military leader in charge of thousands of soldiers, dunked her unprotected hands into the corpse of an unknown alien species.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on when the first question she asks to the medical examiner is the following: ""Are they mammals?""<br/><br/>Nine Hibiscus, please, these aliens seem to have access to technology that may greatly surpass your own. They annihilated hordes of your empire's military like they were ants.<br/><br/>I don't think it's relevant to ask if the alien being in front of you secretes milk out of its breasts.<br/><br/>I've been poisoned by reading Adrian Tchaikovsky's depiction of aliens in his Children of Time series and his The Final Architecture series.<br/><br/>It's done so well in these novels and comparing those depictions with what we get here makes A Desolation Called Peace look real bad.<br/><br/>I'm frustrated and I'm not sure reading more of this book will help with that.<br/><br/>Reading through more of this book, I don't think Arkady Martine knows what a mammal is or how arbitrary of a distinction it is in the context of her story.<br/><br/>Her characters definitely don't. I cannot believe that the mammal fixation is brought up a second time.<br/><br/>If they're mammals we'll be able to speak with them? Ehhhhhhhhhh<br/><br/>A rushed sequel for a book that greatly surpassed expectations and achieved massive critical success.<br/><br/>The constant inconsistencies, the atrocious way the aliens are handled and described is unbelievably bad, the characters's internal monologues going on and on about nothing relevant.<br/><br/>All of this is exhausting. I enjoyed the previous book in the series despite having a few gripes with it but this one is not a great follow up.<br/><br/>I think it succeeds in some ways. Now that the reader is more familiar with the universe, Martine feels comfortable writing the sequel from multiple POVs, in doing so gives herself the opportunity to give us a better sampling of the world.<br/><br/>Does she succeed fully with this? No. The POVs aren't different enough from one another.<br/><br/>But the book feels forced in a way I haven't seen in a novel in a long time. The author starts off with a message about the book being for/by outsiders. But it's not, it tries to be but it's super forced and is coming not from within the story but from without.<br/><br/>Is this a cynical attempt to capture a particular audience? Maybe? I think it's more likely that Martine doesn't understand that good sci fi comes from imagining worlds that are different from our own and seeing how those differences change things and what it might mean for us.<br/><br/>Instead Martine seems to believe that good sci fi is about creating an interesting world and then moving characters from point A to B while they constantly have temper tantrums, eternally question themselves and their skills and fend off assassination attempts.<br/><br/>Every sentence spoken by a character is followed by interminable internal monologuing. Clearly writing like this comes naturally to Martine and sometimes it works but it's too much here.<br/><br/>It's excruciating to read and completely understand someone DNFing this book midway through.<br/><br/>This novel needed more time in the oven and it would have been way better.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a tad satirical. Don't take me too seriously but please do think twice about reading this novel, even if you really enjoyed the previous one. You might be disappointed like I was.<br/><br/>Here's a few reasons why you might give A Desolation Called Peace by Arkady Martine a 5 star review.<br/>- It won the Hugo award for best novel, just like the previous book in the series. Other people seem to like it, I guess I should like it too?<br/>- Both books in the series combined come out to about 1 thousand pages. After spending that much time with a series, it must be good because otherwise look at all this time I've wasted (Sunk Cost Fallacy)<br/>- I really loved A Memory Called Empire, I guess I like the sequel too?<br/><br/>I respect your point of view even if you disagree with mine. But it's so confusing to me, seeing so many people give this novel a perfect score and gush about it, while completely neglecting the aspects of it that are objectively bad.<br/><br/>This novel feels extremely rushed, it likely was rushed out the door by the publisher so that they could most efficiently capitalize on the unexpected acclaim received by the first book. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel after all.<br/><br/>NB: We do live under capitalism. It is what it is.<br/><br/>All the signs of a rushed release are there if you look closely.<br/>1. Awkward run-on sentences are everywhere and cause the reader psychic damage trying to get through them.<br/><br/>Read the following excerpt out loud to see what I mean:<br/><br/><blockquote>The water she'd drunk made her able to talk [author's note: this sentence is atrocious]. Even sing one of the absurd pitched-consonant words that they'd picked up from the aliens in demonstration for the yaotlek, though Mahit was so much better at making those noises that Three Seagrass had begun to plan a scheme in which she taught her how to have some halfway-decent breath and pitch control, pass on the lessons she'd had as a crèche-kid in how to project from the diaphragm when orating.</blockquote><br/><br/>Reading this novel closely, you can and will find many sentences just like this peppered all throughout the text and reading them will drive you insane.<br/><br/>I hate this kind of writing. I don't know where it comes from. It goes against everything I know about good writing. It drives me up the wall.<br/><br/>NB: If you're like me, I highly recommend you also stay away from Ann Leckie's The Raven Tower which suffers from the same kind of long winded writing.<br/>2. The novel has multiple POV characters and their narratorial voices are way too similar and this will encourage you to start drinking, heavily.<br/><br/>Each bit of dialogue, no matter which character's POV we're following, is interspersed with an ungodly amount of stream of consciousness blahblahblah text that is really annoying to read.<br/><br/>If one character was written like this, it's all good. This narration style would define the character and make them unique, and it wouldn't be so overbearing.<br/><br/>The problem is that every single POV character is written like this because I guess that's how Arkady Martine writes and her editor was not given the time and support they needed this time to take out the trash.<br/><br/>Let's look at some examples:<br/><br/><blockquote>Mahit said, ""Well, that's unexpectedly pleasant, all considered,"" and didn't go on any further. She didn't want to—she couldn't tell Three Seagrass that she was here to spy on the war for Darj Tarats, in order to escape Aknel Amnardbat's surgeons. To do worse things for Darj Tarats, if there was an opportunity. She couldn't. So she got into the shuttle instead, settling amongst the supply crates and strapping herself into some freefall-control webbing. There were similar webbings on all of the walls, the floor, the ceiling. It was an efficie""t, well-designed ship. It must make a hundred of these short hops in a month— ""Quite,"" said Three Seagrass, all edges, interest and wariness and a sort of invitation deferred: We can play, Mahit, even if we don't play just now, if playing's what you want.</blockquote><br/><br/>Notice that Arkady Martine explicitly cuts off Mahit's stream of consciousness narration here.<br/><br/>This paragraph is actually cool because there's an intentionality to it. The reader is meant to understand that Mahit is someone who is often stuck in her own head. That's awesome characterization.<br/><br/>The issue is that this narrative voice bleeds into every other character's POV.<br/><br/>For example, in this excerpt, Nine Hibiscus has just been informed by a subordinate that the alien's planet has been found.<br/><br/><blockquote>""If we can get there without them seeing us,"" Nine Hibiscus said. The scatterbombs would do exactly what Eighteen Chisel was imagining. They would, yes, blow anyone out of their sky. And then they'd poison that sky, and the planets below it. The scatterbombs were deathrain. A last resort. Almost never used where people lived— because after them, people didn't live there anymore. She'd only used a scatterbomb barrage once, and that had been against another ship, safe in the blackness of space. The idea of using them on the aliens was— She liked it too much, was what. Liked it too much, too fast. Such a simple solution. So much easier than the rest of the situation she'd been detailing for herself.</blockquote><br/><br/>Huuuuuuuhhhh. Does this sound familiar? If you replace the names in these excerpts, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.<br/><br/>Notice how frequently Arkady Martine uses the ""—"" (em dash) to cut off her character's neverending internal monologues.<br/><br/>You might be wondering, how did I find these examples? Did I carefully sift truth the entire book for the perfect example to present a skewed representation of the book to make my argument more convincing?<br/><br/>No, I opened my book at a random page and found relevant examples each time because the book is filled with them.<br/>3. Final thoughts because reading this book makes me not want to think anymore.<br/><br/>Reading through A Desolation Called Peace has driven me to the brink of insanity and so I find myself ready and able to talk shit about any part of it.<br/>- Arkady Martine's ignorance about biology and linguistics and her decision to hinge her entire novel on these topics that she clearly knows less than nothing about is infuriating.<br/>- Her fixation on the fact that these aliens are mammals (well sort of, wink wink) and how apparently that ISN'T a completely arbitrary distinction to make is wild. If these aliens secret milk out of their breasts, have vertebra and shit, it is not plot critical, please do not fixate on their mammalness.<br/>- Don't get me started on the title of the novel. Cynically, I understand the sequel of a popular book should probably use a similar naming scheme to the first novel to make it clear that it's a sequel and in doing so sell more copies. But, come on, A Desolation Called Peace, is real dumb.<br/><br/>I feel betrayed by the Goodreads and the science fiction community at large for promoting the apparent perfection of this novel.<br/><br/>Although, there are some heroes out there (you know who you are) who knew the truth and tried their best to communicate it, mostly falling on deaf ears.<br/><br/>I should have listened. Maybe then I wouldn't be headed straight for the mental asylum.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a little satirical, please be chill<br/><br/>NB: p. 404, O face due to great diplomacy by Mahit<br/><br/>I've written more than three thousand words between five different first drafts trying to explain exactly why reading A Desolation Called Peace made me so angry. Instead of fumbling with my words, I'll let Ursula K. Le Guin speak for me (quote taken from her essay The Stalin in the Soul).<br/><br/><blockquote>Reading is not a passive reaction, but an action, involving the mind, the emotions, and the will. To accept trashy books because they are ""best-sellers"" is the same thing as accepting adulterated food, ill-made machines, corrupt government, and military and corporative tyranny, and praising them, and calling them the American Way of Life or the American Dream. It is a betrayal of reality. Every betrayal, every lie accepted, leads to the next betrayal and the next lie.</blockquote><br/><br/>Suffice to say that I feel <b>betrayed</b>.<br/><br/>It's clear to me from reading this book closely, that it was rushed to the printing press in an attempt to capitalize on the unexpected (but mostly deserved) acclaim received by the previous book in the series, A Memory Called Empire. With a bit more time in the oven, the sequel could have been fantastic, and yet here we are.<br/><br/>Open the book on any page, put your finger anywhere to find:<br/>- Omnipresent awkward run-on sentences that are begging to be trimmed by a competent editor.<br/>- Multiple POV characters who all suffer from the same never ending stream of consciousness narrative voice that is a pain to read.<br/>- Some absolutely baffling ignorance about aliens, linguistics, the definition of the word ""spy"" and basic biology.<br/><br/>I've rated the book 1 star although it's probably deserving of more (maybe a 2 or a 3), but I need to fight the good fight and do my part to pull this book back into the void where it belongs.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed A Desolation Called Peace, great! Maybe you even rated it 5 stars? Fantastic. I'm truly glad you enjoyed it.<br/><br/>But are you sure that you're really being honest with yourself?<br/><br/>If you don't want to hear what I have to say, fine, but at least listen to Chad Le Guin. If we continue to accept slop like this, praise its greatness, and put it on a pedestal, publishers have no incentive to give authors and editors the time they need to do their best work.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm wrong? Maybe this is really one of the best sci-fi novels of our generation? Maybe the author and the editor and everyone involved got all the time they needed to make A Desolation Called Peace the best it could be.<br/><br/>Well then, if A Desolation Called Peace is the peak of what modern sci-fi can bring to the table, I don't want to read it anymore.",0

I feel confident that although this kind of roleplaying experience is likely to be a little harder to run, I think it would be rewarding to do so, especially with the help of modules like this.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781940410210/"">Delta Green - Agent's Handbook*</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781940410289/"">Delta Green - Handler's Guide</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 3: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781940410548/"">Delta Green - Impossible Landscapes*</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 4: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781940410500/"">Delta Green - Hourglass</a> ★★★★",1

Wild Dice encourage players to let their characters do things that they aren't necessarily good at (especially if it's good roleplaying, which might get them a Benny) because they're more likely to succeed and much less likely to critically fail (requiring snake eyes, which has at worst a 1/24 chance of occurring and at best 1/72) than in other roleplaying games (think DnD).<br/>- It actually does support any kind of setting you can come up with --- it just works.

I'm not sure it's something in-between either, I don't really know what it is. It's OK, I guess?<br/><br/>I didn't hate it but I didn't find it to be very interesting. Compared to <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781399806855"">The Autistic Experience by Joe James and Marie-Laure Del Vecchio</a>, Annie Kotowicz's What I Mean When I Say I'm Autistic lacks the breadth of experience to make it feel like it matters.<br/><br/>Annie Kotowicz's self-reflection and thoughts on her experience of being Autistic, although important to her and those around her, feel like a drop in the pond compared to the 80+ Autistic voices that were featured in The Autistic Experience.<br/><br/>I'm sure the text was a great writing exercise for Annie Kotowicz and I'd love to do something similar for myself. But I question how relevant it is for people other than Annie Kotowicz, her fairy tale boyfriend Jake (this man is either A. not real B. a one in a billion catch C. he kills kids and it's all a facade) or people close to Annie Kotowicz.<br/><br/>For a text that is so focused on one person's experience of being Autistic, I would have expected some more detail about that experience. I would love to know what it felt like to be Annie Kotowicz in those moments where her being Autistic led to real conflict so that I could connect to her on a deeper level.<br/><br/>Annie Kotowicz does talk about moments from her life like this but they're written in such a way that makes her and me as the reader feel so far removed from these events that they're very hard to relate to. It's really hard to relate to the list of behaviors, symptoms and coping mechanisms that the rest of the book can be reduced to at times.<br/><br/>What I Mean When I Say I'm Autistic also doesn't serve as more comprehensive primer on Autism that someone could read and be guided onto a path of self-discovery because of how specific the text is to Annie Kotowicz's experience (the section on Musicals for example, demonstrates this specificity quite well). If you're looking for a more general book on Autism, check out <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781946824912"">Understanding Autism In Adults And Aging Adults by Theresa Regan</a>. I was hoping for Annie Kotowicz to provide me with a shorter, perhaps more compelling ""primer"" on autism, but I definitely didn't get that.<br/><br/>Long story short, I didn't like this text very much. I was expecting something else which I didn't get, so after reading it, I was left feeling a little confused. This is a shame because there are quite a few chapters that have concise, compelling and particularly poignant views on the Autistic experience that deserve to be in a better book.<br/><br/>I might be able to be convinced to read other work by Annie Kotowicz but this book really didn't do it for me.",0
