I'm a fan of Neil Gaiman's work generally but I found this to be quite boring.<br/><br/>Unlike Greek mythology, we don't have many written records describing Norse mythology as it existed. So, there's not really much we know about Norse mythology.<br/><br/>In his book titled Norse Mythology, Neil Gaiman riffs on what we know about the Norse myths and creates his own retellings of the stories and some completely new ones.<br/><br/>It's OK. I like a lot of Neil Gaiman's work (especially American Gods), his passion for mythology is clear and it shines through most of his work. Unfortunately, I don't think I have as much of an appreciation for Norse mythology as he does and reading this book didn't change that.",1

I enjoyed it but it was missing a bit of polish.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the cast of characters being mostly of Canadian Indigenous ancestry (well, except the villain). It's not something I've seen before (which either speaks to my uncultured-ness or the lack of minority voices in the media I'm exposed to... or both).<br/><br/>The story was simple (maybe too simple) but executed well. But it's definitely not a story for a younger demographic though — it's got a few extremely explicit descriptions of sex in it (I've read some erotica in my day but this was something else).<br/><br/>It's a story about a mixed Indigenous lady, Joan, who's husband goes missing.<br/><br/>We follow Joan as she uncovers the mystery about what really happened to her beloved Victor with the help of her cousin Zeus and her extended family.<br/><br/>There's a few surprises along the way. It was a riveting read although the narrative unfolds in a way that left me scratching my head at times.<br/><br/>The choice to zoom in on the backstory of relatively minor characters was a little weird. An attempt was made to make these characters less like caricatures but it wasn't very successful IMO.<br/><br/>The ending comes out of nowhere with characters doing absolutely wacky shit which was really hard for me to believe. It also happens very quickly. I would have preferred a bit more buildup before the end as well as a bit more of a denouement.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed what I read and I'm excited to read whatever Cherie Dimaline comes up with next. I hope it's little more polished next time though!",1

She's able to construct stories that entice you to keep reading despite the underlying story not being all it's cracked up to be.<br/><br/>Her Villains duology leaves me feeling empty. She knows what the big moments she wants to have in her story are and she constantly steers her characters in the direction of those big moments without it feeling earned.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781783290215/"">Vicious*</a> ★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780765387523/"">Vengeful**</a> ★★<br/><br/>Usually her characters haphazardly waffle about, forcing her to quickly redirect the paths of characters such that the big moments can happen as she imagines them.<br/><br/>But these big moments come out of nowhere and don't feel earned. She has a hard time writing characters that feel real.<br/><br/>The choice to go back and forth between various times allows the author to patch holes in her story to make it make more sense. It also gives her an A plot (present) / B plot (past) to keep you occupied. But it's a crutch that hurts more than it helps because it gives her ample room to hang herself with a paper thin plot and cardboard cutout characters.<br/><br/>To be fair, in Vengeful, the characters have a lot more life to them compared to the first novel. It sucks that none of the characters other than our two heartthrob hot men Eli and Victor (the most shippable pair to ever grace a page) matter or have any sort of character arc.<br/><br/>Every character in this story serves only to set up the final confrontation between Eli and Victor. They don't exist outside of that.<br/><br/>I need a break from V. E. Schwab. Her Darker Shades of Magic series is better than this one overall.<br/><br/>The Villains series is all style no substance. It's the novel equivalent of the Transformer movies. It's a ""Blockbuster"", it's got a lot of flashing lights and cool effects but it lacks anything underneath the surface.<br/><br/>There's nothing stopping someone from writing a great story with sexy shippable pairs of all kinds for fans to write heinously explicit fan fiction about but Vengeful isn't one of them.",1

9781400050581,2024/09/17,autism read,read,1,2,"<blockquote>[...] (I rarely make revisions once I have written).</blockquote><br/><br/>No shit girl, we can tell.<br/><br/>This story is about an autistic woman who remembers and describes being born, she goes through some shit (homelessness and stripping, etc.), discovers a passion for gorillas and leverages her understanding of gorillas to help her understand other people.<br/><br/>It's a little too precious and twee for my taste. For fuck's sake, she touches a gorilla and instantly discovers the meaning of true love.<br/><br/>Fucking hell.<br/><br/>Whoever greenlit the god awful poetry that is interspersed throughout this novel should be shot.<br/><br/>This novel has a few nuggets of gold throughout but there's a LOT of problematic and bad writing here. I can't recommend sifting through all this shit to get to the good stuff.<br/><br/>This is an older book (pushing 20+ years old at the time of writing this) and parts of it definitely do not hold up.<br/><br/>The biggest offender is probably the conclusion of the book, which speaks for itself. <br/><br/><blockquote>Though their research is rarely if ever cited any­ more, I agree with Elisabeth and Niko Tinbergen, the authors of “Autistic” Children: New Hope for a Cure, who believe that modern life, with its unnatural living conditions, chemicals, broken-down social systems, and chronic stress, overstimulates and assaults the human animal, causing some to manifest the biological and psychological matrix we call autism.</blockquote><br/><br/>Yikes. Truly heinous beliefs to be dropping on the last page of your book. The ""cure"" for autism is a more understanding society that isn't fixated on alienating and othering people who don't fit into the very specific moulds society expects of us to fit into.<br/><br/>Reading through Songs Of The Gorilla Nation has convinced me that it's not good enough for an author to be autistic and all of a sudden decide to tell their story and expect it to resonate. You have to be a good storyteller if you want to tell a story that expresses your autistic experience in a genuine yet compelling way.<br/><br/>This book does NOT do that.<br/><br/>If you're interested in one that does, check out <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780778307877"">Cassandra in Reverse</a> or <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781399806855"">The Autistic Experience - Silenced Voices Finally Heard </a>!",1

Things quickly go wrong and everyone who's left on the planet is stuck dealing with the consequences of their actions. Our protagonist Renata Ghali in particular is suffering through her existence on the planet and trying to come to terms with her role during Planetfall and the years that followed.<br/><br/>A lot of callbacks to the Planetfall event (when the colonists initially landed on the surface of the planet) without revealing the events specifically. This withholding of critical knowledge is the carrot on the stick that's being used to pull you to the end of the novel but this sort of storytelling is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. It is ""explained"" by the narrator's trauma related to these events but explaining a storytelling device in-universe is not good enough for me to enjoy it. <br/><br/>Other than that, I'm in love with this novel and world. The depiction of someone suffering from a trauma induced hoarding issue is compelling. I've never seen a hoarder depicted in fiction before and I think it's done well here. Having to live with someone with a hoarding issue is something I've experienced and it's nice to an author attempt to depict it well.<br/><br/>The alien life is alien but the revellation of what it really is and what it's doing is not delivered to the reader in a fully satisfying way. It's a little too slow for my taste.<br/><br/>I'm curious to compare this novel with its sequel, <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781473223875/"">After Atlas</a>, which is another book recommendation by <a href=""https://strategineer.com/authors/adrian-tchaikovsky/"">Adrian Tchaikovsky</a>.",1
