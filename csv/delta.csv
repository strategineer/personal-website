9780241982358,2021/12/01,myth reference read,read,1,5,"Robert Graves's The Greek Myths is more of an encyclopedia about everything related to the Greek myths rather than a pure retelling of the myths themselves. It's not meant to entertain, it's meant to inform. Although, if learning everything there is to know about Greek myths sounds entertaining to you then this is the book for you.<br/><br/>I've always been fascinated by Greek mythology but my understanding of it came from the sanitized stories I read in D'Aulaires Book Of Greek Myths and secondhand from the many modern interpretations of the myths I had seen throughout my life.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/d_aulaires_book_of_greek_myths.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""271"" /><br/><br/>Prior to reading this book, I had never really taken the time to dive deep into Greek mythology.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did because now I cringe thinking about all the times I said that I prefer Greek mythology to Christianity because it's: ""way funner"".<br/><br/>I mean, in some ways, it is buuuuuuut also Zeus rapes a lot (they don't really talk about that in d'Aulaires illustrated book for kids)...<br/><br/>If you want to learn about every single Greek myth that exists, then you should read this book. Otherwise, you should stay far far away from it.",1

After reading it, you'll be able to see it echoed everywhere you look.<br/><br/>I've never read the Odyssey, and so I chose to read a recent translation of it by Emily Wilson.<br/><br/>It's written in modern English making it easy to read. There's no reason to use archaic English, which apparently is the norm with these kinds of texts, when translating a text that was originally in Greek. It's a poem with the same number of lines as the original which is just plain fun.<br/><br/>It's an interesting text and now I understand why some people decide to spend their entire lives thinking about it.<br/><br/>Odysseus is a mass murderer and a villain… yet in the story he's presented as a victim and a hero. It's… complex.<br/><br/>I can understand why some people have spent their entire lives studying this story and Greek mythology in general (especially after also reading Robert Grave's The Greek Myths).<br/><br/>Zeus rapes a lot and there's a lot of murder, but if you can stomach it, Greek Mythology is a wild ride.<br/><br/>These stories keep being retold again and again in different forms and understanding where all these tropes come from is fun.<br/><br/>Sonic is Hermes.<br/><br/>One Piece is a retelling of Jason's, and the Argonauts's, quest for the Golden Fleece.<br/><br/>Odysseus is a superhero, with powers coming from Athena's favor, straight out of a comic book (or Marvel movie). Normal humans can't murder a hundred people with a bow in a dining hall, make anyone believe anything and wear some rags to perfectly disguise their identity.<br/><br/>But that's in part what makes the story interesting.",1

I need to become more comfortable with dropping a book if it's not good enough and lowering my ""shitty book"" threshold.",1
