Sasha attends this mysterious college and is thrust into a world of dark academia with widespread and fantastical implications.<br/><br/><blockquote>“Attention, students,” continued Portnov just as softly. “You are at the beginning of a journey, during which all of your strength will be required. Physical and mental. What we will be studying is not for everyone. Not everyone can handle what this does to a person. You have been carefully selected, and you all have what it takes to make that journey successfully. Our science does not tolerate weakness and takes cruel revenge on laziness, on cowardice, and on the most infinitesimal attempt to avoid learning the entire curriculum. Is that understood?”</blockquote><br/><br/><b>Minor spoilers to follow</b><br/><br/>I blasted my way through this novel, I would be lying if I didn't mention that it pulled me in with compelling mysteries and fantastic mind bending depictions of a character who's mind is bending in ways it shouldn't.<br/><br/><blockquote>She detonated herself like a grenade, ran all over in a stream, and enveloped the entire auditorium in a thin fog. A split second, and the fog thickened and charged at [...], storming into his nostrils, pouring into his throat, catching the foreign breath.<br/><br/>A scent of cologne flashed. It became dark.<br/><br/>One more second. Sasha lay crumpled like a wet rug. In heavy drops she poured onto the wooden floor, flowed into the wide cracks between the planks, collected into a puddle. A new second: Sasha lay limp, her clothes soaked through, gelatinous like a jellyfish, without a single muscle, without a single thought. The unseasonably warm February sun beat into the windows of the brightly lit auditorium 14.</blockquote><br/><br/>Unfortunately this novel loves setting up mysteries but doesn't know how to unravel them in a satisfying way. The mysteries and the way they were handled were part of why I was so enraptured by the story but the mysteries eventually, especially through the process of being revealed, lost their luster and lessened my appreciation for everything that happened leading up to the reveals. <br/><br/>Marina and Sergey Dyachenko seem to love flaunting the fact that most of the explanations behind these mysteries are being withheld from Sasha (and the reader) for seemingly no reason, other than to act as a carrot on the stick for the reader to follow, over and over again. Here are just a few examples:<br/><br/><blockquote>“Because you never explained to us what we are being taught, let alone why!”<br/><br/>“You would not be able to understand it. It’s too early.”</blockquote><br/><br/>...<br/><br/><blockquote>“Too early, my girl. It’s too soon for you to know. Right now you are still a slave of a framework, a plaster mold with a hint of imagination. With memory, with a personality . . </blockquote><br/><br/>...<br/><br/><blockquote>“That thing that was there . . . What is it?”<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>“That, Alexandra, is too early for you to know. No need. I promise you, though—you will. You will find out during your exam.”</blockquote><br/><br/>This book has some interesting ideas, I just wish they were laid out in a different way and paid off eventually.<br/><br/>The idea of an exclusive college teaching students secret knowledge about the world is a really compelling premise and I can see why this premise is so popular. But the terrible wrapping up of the mysteries and the incomprehensible ending has thrown me for such a loop that I feel myself actively resisting thinking about this book as anything else other than a missed opportunity that isn't worth thinking too much about.",1

It has a lot to say about the world of today on the verge of collapse due to the destruction of our climate, poorly thought through technology, rampant late capitalism and the ever enticing venus flytrap of ideology.<br/><br/><blockquote>""We mustn't run short of filmbase,"" the Duke said. ""Else, how could we flood village and city with our information? The people must learn how well I govern them. How would they know if we didn't tell them?""</blockquote><br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780441172719/"">Dune***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780593098233/"">Dune Messiah***</a> ★★★★<br/><br/>Having watched both David Lynch's Dune and Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part One, I feel like although both are interesting and good in their own way (yes, even the David Lynch movie), Dune is a story best told as a novel, by adapting Dune into a movie you lose a lot of what makes Dune interesting.<br/><br/>Maybe if Jodorowsky had been able to achieve his vision of a 15 hour long movie adaptation of Dune, I'd feel differently... but here we are.<br/><br/>What makes Frank Herbert's Dune novel so special for me? Well, it's a few things. The concerns present in the text (environmental, technological, late capitalism-related, ideological) have only become more relevant in the decades since the novel was written.<br/><br/>The novel is by no means perfect and one could argue that Denis Villeneuve's movie is a better and more cohesive ""product"" compared to the novel. But Denis Villeneuve's movie suffers from being a big budget movie that has to condense and drop many of the more interesting parts of the novel and whitewash or completely remove the novel's more subversive ideas.<br/><br/>Another part of the novel that I enjoy quite a bit which isn't present in the movies is Frank Herbert's mastery of the shifting POV. Multiple POV characters is not anything new to me, almost every single novel I read has multiple POV characters. Dune is different because it has an omniscient narrator that dives deep into the psyche of each of the characters it's focusing on, showing the reader their inner thoughts and concerns while also smoothly flowing from one character to the next within the same chapter, even the same paragraph.<br/><br/><blockquote>One thought remained to him. [POV Character 1] saw it in formless light on rays of black: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain.<br/><br/>Silence.<br/><br/>[POV Character 2] stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole behind the table. He had slammed it on a room full of dead men. His senses took in guards swarming around him. Did I breathe it? he asked himself.</blockquote><br/><br/>I'm not too surprised why this is rarely done today. It must be hard to do well and even when done well it's much harder for the reader to follow. It seems as though a lot of readers today, perhaps this has always been true, skim through the texts they read. You can't skim through a text like Dune and expect to understand what's going on at all times because of the constantly switching focus of the omniscient narrator.<br/><br/>Are there any problems with Frank Herbert's Dune? Absolutely. The one issue that stands out to me is the introduction of Feyd-Rautha in the last quarter of the book. Unlike every other character in the novel who is introduced early on and built upon throughout the text, Feyd-Rautha shows up out of nowhere and we're expected to care about his bullshit.<br/><br/>I wonder if this discrepancy comes from Dune's initial publication as a two-part serial? I don't know but it doesn't work for me. Feyd-Rautha should have been introduced way earlier which would have given the reader more time to build the character up in their minds before the final confrontation with him at the end of the novel.<br/><br/>I'm in love with Dune and I'm committed to reading through its sequel Dune Messiah next. If I enjoy that, I'll likely be taking a look at Children of Dune sooner than later.<br/><br/>PS: Special mention to Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son. Reading through Brian's afterword to Dune and his foreword to the sequel Dune Messiah brought me a lot of joy because of how childish, clownish and delusional Brian Herbert seems to be.<br/><br/><blockquote>As if whispering in his own ear, Frank Herbert constantly reminded himself that he was mortal. If he had been a politician, he would have undoubtedly been an honorable one, perhaps even one of our greatest U.S. presidents.</blockquote><br/><br/>Also, Brian Herbert is clearly someone who does not understand what made his father's work resonate so widely and the fact that the ""Dune"" torch was passed down to him is truly sad.

Our ""hero"".<br/><br/><blockquote>""Some of my friends have forgotten they once were Fremen,"" Paul said, speaking to Korba, but designing his words for Stilgar. ""You will mark down the ones Chani identifies as Sardaukar and you will have them killed. Do it yourself. I want it done quietly and without undue disturbance. We must keep in mind that there’s more to religion and government than approving treaties and sermons.</blockquote><br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780441172719/"">Dune***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780593098233/"">Dune Messiah***</a> ★★★★<br/><br/>Paul was never a good, as in doing the right thing, kind of character. In Dune, his mother Jessica, as a Bene Gesserit, puts him on the path to become a manufactured messiah destined to cause the deaths of billions of innocent people. We see him fight against this destiny throughout the text but in the end he succumbs to it, takes the crown of the Padishah Emperor and begins his forceful subjugation of the known universe.<br/><br/>In Dune Messiah, 12 years later he's fulfilled the destiny set out for him by the Bene Gesserit, and it's made much more explicit that despite being a Chosen One (albeit a manufactured one), he's not someone we should look up to or seek to emulate.<br/><br/><blockquote>""I am not on Arrakis,"" she said. ""I'm a passenger on a Guild heighliner in free space.""<br/><br/>""There is no such thing as free space, Madame.""<br/><br/>She read hate mingled with profound suspicion in his tone.<br/><br/>""Muad'dib rules everywhere,"" he said.</blockquote><br/><br/>Being disappointed that some readers read Dune and thought otherwise, Frank Herbert went all the way in the sequel to really hit you on the head with Paul's awfulness.<br/><br/><blockquote>""Ghengis ... Khan? Was he of the Sardaukar, m'Lord?""<br/><br/>""Oh, long before that. He killed ... perhaps four million.""<br/><br/>""He must've had formidable weaponry to kill that many, Sire. Las beams, perhaps, or ...""<br/><br/>""He didn't kill them himself, Stil. He killed the way I kill, by sending out his legions. There's another emperor I want you to note in passing—a Hitler. He killed more than six million. Pretty good for those days.""</blockquote><br/><br/>Frank Herbert is skeptical of the great man theory and his Dune series tackles that seriously. Having been steeped in American politics working as a speech writer for US presidents for many years seems to have given Frank Herbert more than just a little skepticism about ""great"" men.<br/><br/>If you were expecting another Hero's Journey from Dune Messiah (even a mocking portrayal or parody of one) after reading Dune's, expect to be disappointed because Dune Messiah is not that. If Dune was all about Paul Atreides's rise to power, Dune Messiah is about his fall. <br/><br/>Dune Messiah luxuriates in the awfulness of Paul and is expecting you to root for the dissidents that are trying to bring his reign to an end despite them being just as awful as Paul (but much less powerful). I don't think that all people in power should be torn down forcefully from their golden thrones but some definitely should and to see this portrayed in fiction, especially in a novel written so many decades ago, is great.<br/><br/>Other writers would have walked back some of the more subversive themes in Dune after it became such a massive hit to sell more copies instead of double downing on these ideas like he did. And the novel is much more interesting because of it.<br/><br/>Frank Herbert is also skeptical of groups (or perhaps he just likes to write about awful people of all kinds). The Bene Gesserit are an all-women organisation that most of the women in the novel belong to. The Bene Gesserit represent a kind of soft power that control people and influence them through relationships, lineages, genes. They are awful. It's not just that they are partially responsible for Paul's rise to power but at every turn they will surprise you with how low they are willing to go in their game of morality Limbo.<br/><br/><blockquote>The Reverend Mother sighed. On the surface, it was the sigh of a prisoner bemoaning her fate, but inwardly she felt the response as a comment on Irulan. It was futile to hope the Atreides Emperor’s precious gene pattern could be preserved through this instrument. No matter her beauty, this Princess was flawed. Under that veneer of sexual attraction lived a whining shrew more interested in words than in actions. Irulan was still a Bene Gesserit, though, and the Sisterhood reserved certain techniques to use on some of its weaker vessels as insurance that vital instructions would be carried out.<br/><br/>Beneath small talk about a softer pallet, better food, the Reverend Mother brought up her arsenal of persuasion and gave her orders: the brother-sister crossbreeding must be explored. (Irulan almost broke at receiving this command.)</blockquote><br/><br/>Frank Herbert is not a luddite but he is concerned with technology's ability to amplify the worst parts of our humanity. This is clearly a concern of his in Dune; refer to the Butlerian Jihad and his treatment of the ""family atomics"" eg. nuclear weapons. Dune Messiah expands on this theme through the Tleilaxu, who are a people with comparatively advanced technology without any pesky morality getting in the way of their technological ""progress"". <br/><br/><blockquote>This was a Tleilaxu thing. The Tleilaxu displayed a disturbing lack of inhibitions in what they created. Unbridled curiosity might guide their actions. They boasted they could make anything from the proper human raw material—devils or saints. They sold killer-mentats. They’d produced a killer medic, overcoming the Suk inhibitions against the taking of human life to do it. Their wares included willing menials, pliant sex toys for any whim, soldiers, generals, philosophers, even an occasional moralist.</blockquote><br/><br/>Like any good work of sci-fi, Dune Messiah, and the series as a whole so far, is like an onion. Under every layer you'll find more ideas to think about and discuss than you might expect. But if you're anything like me, you might find that most of the concerns Frank Herbert had in the 60s when he wrote these books have only gotten more concerning in the intervening decades and, thus, you might find yourself peeling back this onion that is the Dune series and finding more reasons to cry than you might have expected.",1

But Le Guin's economy of words, using few words to say a lot, is her biggest strength and makes reading her books (barring The Farthest Shore of course) a joy and makes the underlying ideas easier to bring to the surface.<br/><br/>Whereas Wolfe goes out of his way to hide hidden his ideas all throughout his texts, which is interesting in its own way, but sometimes his commitment to obscuring everything in a layer of mystery and complexity can get in the way of telling a compelling story in a compelling way (refer to the Fifth Head of Cerberus).",1
