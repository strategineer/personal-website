I don't think that was the intention of the author almost one hundred years ago when it was first published but reading it now I was chuckling nonstop at how campy and absurd it is.<br/><br/>Hercules Poiroit, the world famous private investigator specializing in murders, finds himself on a boat on the Nile. He was looking to go on vacation, take a break from his work and relax.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for M. Poirot, there are more than a dozen rich British people on the boat with him capable of murder.<br/><br/>Soon enough a murder is committed and then it's up to M. Poirot and his buddy Colonel Race (who also happens to be on the same boat for some reason) to solve the crime.<br/><br/>Think about what that would actually be like and take a gander at a few scenes I've picked out which had me rolling on the floor laughing.<br/><br/>Scene 1:<br/><br/>Hello world famous private investigator specializing in murder investigations, let me talk to you about who I want to kill in precise detail and also here's the gun I'm going to use.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Scene 2:<br/><br/><b>""So we've got to go somewhere.</b><br/><b>[...] ""I suppose we might as well go on to Egypt. It doesn't make any difference.""</b><br/><b>""It's certainly not a matter of life or death,"" agreed Mrs Otterbourne.</b><br/><b>But there she was quite wrong - for a matter of life and death was exactly what it was.</b><br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Scene 3:<br/><br/><b>""Oh, yes, Mrs Robson. I went over to Paris with Miss Van Schuyler last Fall. But I've never been to Egypt before."" Mrs Robson hesitated.</b><br/><b>""I do hope -------- there won't be any -------- trouble.""</b><br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Scene 4:<br/><br/>Lady who is probably going to die: HELLO M. POIROT, PLEASE HELP ME. EVERYONE HATES ME.<br/><br/>I'M GOING TO DIE.<br/><br/>I'M GOING TO DIE.<br/><br/>I'M GOING TO DIE.<br/><br/>M. Poirot: Uhhh chill out lady, don't be melodramatic.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Now, after reading through the whole novel some of the absurdity earlier in the book is explained (it's a mystery after all) but there's no explanation for the extreme campiness other than this being a product of its time.<br/><br/>And, I absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>What didn't I like?<br/>1. Well, the book was written by a British lady almost a hundred years ago so unless you're reading a censored version of the text, you should expect a healthy dose of Imperialism with a side of racism.<br/>2. The campiness dries up about halfway through the book and then ramps back up until the finale. I wasn't as interested in the ""by the numbers solving the mystery"" part of the story. It was fine, probably good even, if that's what you're looking for but I wanted the story to be all camp all the time.<br/><br/>I loved my time with Death on the Nile, if you love camp then you're going to love this book. It's a great book club book!",1

Once again, she manages to create a fantasy world where violence doesn't solve everything. Her characters engage in the mundane activities that real people do most of the time: chat, make friends, think about their loved ones, cuddle with their pets, etc. The way she writes these mundane scenes makes them feel just as important and interesting as they really are.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-30/"">A Wizard Of Earthsea</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-02/"">The Tombs Of Atuan</a> ★★★★<br/>Book 3: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-21/"">The Farthest Shore</a> ★★★<br/>Book 4: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-27/"">Tehanu</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 5: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-06/"">Tales From Earthsea*</a> ★★★★<br/>Book 6: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-26/"">The Other Wind**</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 6.1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-27/"">The Books of Earthsea: The Complete Illustrated Edition**</a> ★★★★<br/><br/><b>""The world's vast and strange, Hara, but no vaster and no stranger than our minds are. Think of that sometimes.""</b><br/><br/>Hanging out with a friend or a loved one is one of the greatest things a human can do and yet how often do we see this honestly portrayed in fantasy? Yet, The Other Wind is the most ""fantasy"" fantasy book in the Earthsea series, featuring many tropes that you may have seen before (tropes: <spoiler>a restoration narrative, a mage haunted by his dark past, a king's romance with a princess from another land, a conflict occurring on the edges of the known world, etc. </spoiler>) yet subverts or manages to make each of these tropes more interesting and grounded in reality than they would otherwise be if written by a less competent author.<br/><br/><b>""Maybe your gift will come back to you, when what must happen has happened. I cannot promise that. I will try to restore what I can of what I take from you. But we're all walking in the night, now, on ground we don't know. When the day comes we may know where we are, or we may not. [...]""</b><br/><br/>As a conclusion to the Earthsea series, it succeeds in many ways. What I love about it most is how well Le Guin manages to do perspective shifting between the different POV characters, some new and some returning from previous books in the series.<br/><br/>In doing so, Le Guin manages to show us the characters we've been following through their journeys so far, where they're at now and where they're going as well as giving us the most comprehensive view on the inner workings of the world of Earthsea we've gotten in the series so far. It's rare for a final book in a series to hit as hard as the first, The Other Wind got pretty close for me.<br/><br/><b>So, here in the center where earth's powers met, the human powers had also met together: a king, a princess, the masters of wizardry.</b><br/><b>And the dragons. And a priestess-thief turned farmwife, and a village sorcerer with a broken heart...</b><br/><br/>It's a great conclusion to the series. Now that I've read the whole series I can confirm with certainty that the third book, The Farthest Shore, is not worth reading, unless you're a super fan who needs to know just how bad it is. The Other Wind feels like Le Guin's rerun of The Farthest Shore in more ways than one. Thankfully, The Other Wind succeeds where The Farthest Shore does not.",1
9780552134620,2023/11/13,fiction fantasy comic read,read,1,5,"The first novel in Terry Pratchett's City/Night Watch series featuring the drunk and depressed Captain Vimes, the human who thinks he's a dwarf Carrot, the everyman Nobby and the boomer Sergeant Colon. They act like a tight knit four man improv group, bouncing off each other really well and provide a great foundation for the humor, action and hijinks in the novel.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-13/"">Guards! Guards!***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 7: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-12/"">Thud!***</a> ★★★★★<br/><br/>After reading Thud! and enjoying that, I decided to start reading the entire Discworld City/Night Watch series from the start.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes suffers from a combination of alcoholism and depression leading to his skewed perspective of the world.<br/><br/><b>Lessee . . . he'd gone off after the funeral and got drunk. No, not drunk, another word, ended with ‘er'. Drunker, that was it. Because world all twisted up and wrong, like distorted glass, only came back into focus if you looked at it through bottom of bottle.</b><br/><br/>Carrot is a human who was adopted by dwarven parents and so he's essentially a dwarf in a human body.<br/><br/><b>""Oh, give up!"" he said. ""Are you going to come quietly?"" The mumbling went on. The air began to feel hot and dry. Vimes shrugged. ""That's it, then,"" he said, and turned away. ""Throw the book at him, Carrot."" ""Right, sir."" Vimes remembered too late.</b><br/><b>Dwarfs have trouble with metaphors. They also have a very good aim. The Laws and Ordinances of Ankh and Morpork caught the [...] on the forehead. He blinked, staggered, and stepped backwards. It was the longest step he ever took. For one thing, it lasted the rest of his life.</b><br/><br/>Nobby is the everyman, he is very down to earth.<br/><br/><b>It always amazed Vimes how Nobby got along with practically everyone. It must, he'd decided, have something to do with the common denominator. In the entire world of mathematics there could be no denominator as common as Nobby.</b><br/><br/>Sergeant Colon is the boomer of the group.<br/><br/><b>Sergeant Colon owed thirty years of happy marriage to the fact that Mrs Colon worked all day and Sergeant Colon worked all night. They communicated by means of notes. He got her tea ready before he left at night, she left his breakfast nice and hot in the oven in the mornings. They had three grown-up children, all born, Vimes had assumed, as a result of extremely persuasive handwriting.</b><br/><br/>These are the men who've been tasked with keeping the city safe. Conveniently, Ankh-Morpork quickly finds itself under attack by a powerful force and Captain Vimes and his constables (with a LOT of help from the larger than life noblewoman Lady Sybil Ramkin and her stable of swamp dragons) are the only people standing in the way of the total destruction of the city.<br/><br/>Guards! Guards! is not my favorite of Terry Pratchett's work. It's one of his earlier novels in the Discworld universe so he's still figuring things out.<br/><br/>The parts where the POV shifts away from the Night Watch (and Sybil) are not as compelling and could have probably been edited away.<br/><br/>But, everything else is great. The jokes land. The characters are paper thin and yet somehow Terry manages to make them come to life anyway. Their chemistry is off the charts and it's a joy to read.<br/><br/>Of course, Carrot being a dwarf in a human body can be read as him being autistic (one of many examples of autistic representation in Terry Pratchett's work).<br/><br/>He takes things very literally. He's oblivious to social cues. It's pretty on the nose.<br/><br/>I appreciate this depiction because despite him being a caricature, every other character is too. He's never the butt of the joke, his actions might be what cause a comical situation to occur but we're not laughing at him. We're laughing at the situation that Carrot and the other constables find themselves in.<br/><br/>Carrot, unlike the rest of Night Watch, seems to be genuinely happy about being a constable (proven by the letters he regularly writes to his parents back home). He has a positive outlook on life and is happy to be where he is. Over time, his positive outlook rubs off on the other constables, gets them to get off their asses and get to work helping people.<br/><br/>Carrot is oblivious to the fact that when he first comes to Ankh-Morpork, he's essentially working as a bouncer for a whorehouse (he believes that the Lady of the house just has a bunch of unmarried daughters).<br/><br/>Sure, he's different but that's OK. This is one example of many in Terry Pratchett's work of characters who are really out there and different and people around them love them anyway.<br/><br/>The implication, whether that was Terry's intent or not, is that you can be different in your own way and you can be loved too.<br/><br/>The real world isn't as simple as a Terry Pratchett novel. But his work is a constant reminder that there's at least one person on the planet who understood a part of my struggle and accepts me (and people like me) for who I am.<br/><br/>If there's one person like Terry out there, there's got to be more. Even though Terry passed away in 2015, the positive influence of his work continues to spread and I suspect (and I hope) that many people will continue to enjoy his work for many generations to come.<br/><br/>His work deserves it.",1

The upcoming anniversary of the thousands years old Battle of Koom Valley is keeping tension high between the dwarves and the trolls; making it harder for the constables of the Watch to keep the peace and solve the crime.<br/><br/>Thud! is a Terry Pratchett novel through and through. There's ample comedy interlaced with impactful action scenes with just a little bit of drama sprinkled in. This time around, it's a little grittier and darker than usual.<br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-13/"">Guards! Guards!***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 7: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-12/"">Thud!***</a> ★★★★★<br/><br/><b>It would be a lot simpler [...] if this was a story. A sword is pulled out of a stone or a magic ring is flung into the depths of the sea, and with general rejoicing the world turns.</b><br/><b>But this was real life. The world didn't turn, it just went into a spin.</b><br/><br/>Thud! is about prejudice. The main plot as well as every sub plot has something to say about prejudice, how it can cloud our judgement and prevent us from doing the right thing and treating everyone with the respect they deserve.<br/><br/>The choice to have the protagonist be a prototypical white man in a position of power is great because I would have had a hard time taking the novel seriously if Terry Pratchett, a very white man, had chosen to tell this story from the perspective of a minority.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes is an honest man doing the best he can but sometimes that's just not good enough. So, for me, throughout the novel, he flip-flopped between being the hero I was rooting for and the antihero I loved to hate.<br/><br/><b>Minor story spoilers</b><br/><spoiler><br/>An example of this is when Sam Vimes suffers a particularly heinous attack from a few deep dwarves. He feels extremely angry and frustrated about this (rightfully so) but unfortunately he expresses that anger by mistreating other dwarves who had nothing to do with the attack.<br/><br/>This hits home for me because it's something we see time and time again in our own world.<br/><br/>For example, post-911, Muslims around the world suffered from an increase in hate crimes against them. This is a tragedy because the actions of a few extremists (completely divorced from Islam) led to all this hate being directed towards the wrong people. Another more recent example of this was post-COVID, there was a similar increase in hate crimes towards Asian people who, obviously, had nothing to do with COVID, other than suffering because of it like everyone else.<br/><br/>So when Vimes starts getting pissed at dwarves in the same way, it felt real.<br/></spoiler><br/>Thud! is filled with situations like this; touching on issues like discrimination in the workplace, police brutality, racism, etc. that lend a weight to the story that isn't usually present in other Discworld novels. I'm really into it!<br/><br/>Thud! was published right after Going Postal (which is my favorite Discworld novel I've read so far) and they seem to share quite a bit of DNA. With Going Postal dealing with capitalism, toxic corporate culture, bureaucracy (and more!) instead of the topics covered in Thud!.<br/><br/>If you like Going Postal, you might like Thud! (and vice-versa). I love both tremendously.<br/><br/>As of right now, Thud! has taken my second favorite Terry Pratchett novel slot; bumping Thief of Time down to a respectable third place.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with Terry Pratchett. He's just so consistently good at what he does, and I love his work because of it.",1

They're instinctual and they're deeply ingrained in us.<br/><br/>Two people who are blind at birth, when speaking to each other, will make gestures despite neither of them being able to see the gestures.<br/><br/>Words are great, but by limiting ourselves to words and only words, we're missing out on a wide range of tools we can use to express ourselves. Especially in informal contexts, where expressing how you feel quickly and easily, without having to be a genius writer, is useful.<br/><br/>In the letters that people used to write to each other (in a pre-internet world), it was quite common to see words mixed in with doodles of hearts and smiley faces.<br/><br/>We've been doing this for a long time, it's just that the way we imbue gestures into our writing has changed as the technologies we use to communicate with each other have evolved.<br/><br/>In the West, we started off with emoticons like :-P, :(, ;) (the nose was dropped sometime in the 2000s).<br/><br/>In Asia, kaomoji were used in similar ways.<br/><br/>^\_^<br/><br/>o_O<br/><br/>¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯<br/><br/>Sidenote: You'll notice that emoticons tend to have similar eyes and different mouths whereas the opposite can be said for kaomoji. This is because in Asia, it's more common for people to look at someone's eyes when trying to figure out that person's emotional state. Whereas people in the West tend to look at mouths instead.<br/><br/>This might explain why anime characters usually have gigantic eyes...<br/><br/>We have the Japanese to thank for many things, emoji is just one of them.[^1] In 1999, Shigetaka Kurita was inspired by the use of symbolic representations in manga, like a water drop on someone's face to represent nervousness or confusion, and created one of the first emoji sets for cellphones.<br/><br/>In the late 2000s, Apple decided that they wanted their iPhones to support emojis specifically for the Japanese market. They did the work to make that happen and, finally, decided to add support for emojis across the globe.<br/><br/>Emojis caught on in a big way all over the world and, eventually, they became ubiquitous (if you're chatting with someone on the internet in 2022, no matter what application you're using, you probably have access to emojis and you likely use them quite a bit).<br/><br/>Because Internet also talks about the various ways in which people have tried to imbue tone of voice into their internet writing (with varying degrees of success).<br/><br/><b>hey</b><br/><b>you</b><br/><b>listen</b><br/><br/>Short utterances without punctuation like this might have been popular with the zoomers on Tumblr/Twitter?<br/><br/><b>I'm ~very~ excited about this ~new~ sarcasm marker.</b><br/><br/>But no, actually, I am.

She becomes like her namesake from myth who could see into the future but was cursed to never be believed.<br/><br/>Cassandra begins to use her power to change her past, present and future and, in doing so, discovers who she is and who she wants to become.<br/><br/>That's the gist of it. It's a really well told story (with properly thought out time travel mechanics) that will keep you hooked and waiting with expectation to see what happens next.<br/><br/><b>Everything is too far away and too close at the same time, too loud and also too quiet; a yellow door, an orange can, a blue sliver of sky, a dropped navy glove, the red ring around a street sign; a kaleidoscope turning.</b><br/><b>A pigeon flaps violently and I put my hands over my face.</b><br/><b>It's coming.</b><br/><b>It's coming and without my banana muffin there is nothing I can do to stop it.</b><br/><br/>Like a cathartic Greek myth, Cassandra in Reverse has high highs and low lows (and everything in between) that'll make you smile and cry (or at least tear up a little if you're an emotionally stunted man child like me hehehe).<br/><br/>Cassandra reads as autistic from page 1. The dust jacket describes the author as having received an autism diagnosis in 2021. From the very start, it's obvious that Cassandra in Reverse is about autism.<br/><br/>All the challenges Cassandra faces at the start of the novel are the result of her being autistic and living in world (like our own) that is usually unfriendly and, sometimes, outright hostile to people who think and act differently than the majority (including autistic people).<br/><br/>As a fellow autist, I found Cassandra's journey very relatable (not the ""being able to control time"" part but the ""being an autist"" part).<br/><br/>Reading through it and relating Cassandra's struggles to my own gave me a boost of positive energy and good vibes that I was craving. There's something magical about reading a book that feels purposefully written to cater to you and your interests.<br/><br/>Depictions of autism in media are mostly terrible. This skews the public perception of autism making it that much harder to get people to understand what it actually is and how it affects people.<br/><br/>Cassandra in Reverse portrays an autistic character so well that it serves as a crash course into what autism can look like. This depiction can allow readers to gain a better understanding of autism and, in doing so, might lead some readers down the path of diagnosis and, hopefully, a better life.<br/><br/>I can attest to the fact that being autistic and not knowing about it is one of the worst experiences I've lived through (not everybody lives through it).<br/><br/>Everything you do is wrong and you don't understand why. People look at you funny and you don't understand why. You have to fight tooth and nail for things that come naturally to other people.<br/><br/>It can negatively impact every single part of your life and it really sucks.<br/><br/>Once you understand what autism is and how it affects you, you can finally have a chance at leading a life of happiness instead of one of constant alienation.<br/><br/>If reading Cassandra in Reverse is what it takes to make someone go from not knowing about their autism to knowing about it then not only is it a well written novel that'll make you FEEL THINGS (tm) but it's also providing an invaluable service to humanity.<br/><br/>And so, I'm giving it 5 stars and nobody can stop me.",1

Eventually, he leaves the Tower he has called home for his entire life and embarks on an adventure becoming an executioner for hire where he roams around, kills people for the state, meets a diverse cast of characters and discovers the, absolutely wild, world he lives in.<br/><br/>Gene Wolfe is known for writing stories from the perspective of characters deeply embedded in the narrative. His Book of the New Sun is no exception. Severian doesn't ever do any exposition or go out his way to explain facets of his world that are obvious to him and obvious to the fictional audience he's writing the story for.<br/><br/>Also, Severian is biased, he disguises the truth, he's not always paying attention to what he should be paying attention to and he can't tell the difference between his memories and his dreams.<br/><br/>All of this puts you as the reader in a state of perpetual confusion and forces you to constantly interpret the events, and re-interpret past events, in the novel as you are exposed to more and more contextual information and details revealed by Severian. This framing for the story combined with the far future setting as well Severian's, let's just say unreliability as a narrator, makes for a compelling read.<br/><br/>The meta-ness of it all with Gene Wolfe writing a story about a torturer in a far future for us, the current day, reader, with this torturer writing about himself from his biased and insane perspective for his audience is very compelling.<br/><br/>I could spend hours discussing any randomly chosen paragraph from the first half of the Book of the New Sun. It's dense, multi-faceted and layered unlike anything I've ever read. It's begging to be read multiple times over which I'm already planning to do despite only being halfway through the series as I write this.<br/><br/>The first part of the The Book of the New Sun was published in 1980, way before the era of trigger warnings in novels. If you're sensitive to that, please inform yourself ahead of time before diving into this series because it's grim as hell and contains many events and themes that some people might find uncomfortable (and understandably so).<br/><br/>Barring that, I can recommend this series, or at least what I've read of it so far, to anyone interested in high concept yet grounded sci-fi/fantasy stories.",1

It follows in the footsteps of the first two books by giving us another story about characters (various uplifted species, human/AI constructs and one fungi species) being thrust together onto another planet.<br/><br/>As per usual, hijinks ensue.<br/></spoiler><br/>||| Spoilers how the story is told |||<br/><spoiler><br/><br/>I think that the two previous books had better pacing and were more interesting rollercoaster rides. This one isn't bad per say but I didn't like it as much. The story is told out of order and that's usually a hard sell for me (although I did appreciate being told when/where the chapters were taking place in the timeline).<br/><br/>Children of Memory fell a little flat for me because I prefer novels that don't withhold information from the reader to inject mystery and intrigue into a story instead of just telling an interesting story in the first place. Children of Memory feels more like an M. Night. Shyamalan movie this time around.<br/></spoiler><br/>||| More spoilers ahead |||<br/><spoiler><br/><br/>Withholding a bit of information is fine as long as the story being told holds up on its own without the reader knowing about the ""twist"". There's a few chapters that feel pretty miserable to read because they're sort of remixes of previous chapters (the child POV also didn't really help with this). At times it felt like Adrian was padding out the page count instead of trying to tell an interesting story.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed reading through Children of Memory. I applaud it for being a little avant garde in terms of how the story is told but I'm not sure that it completely sticks the landing.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the series or you're interested in unpacking some of the philosophical questions raised by the book, I can recommend it.<br/><br/><b>""You don't think what they have here, their culture, their traditions, is worth preserving?""
