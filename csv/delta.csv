When we change how does that effect us and does that effect others around us?<br/><br/>I've only read through 100 pages of this so far, covering the formation of the main team leading up to their handling of a problem involving a memetic fictional city (think Carcosa in the King in Yellow) that is taking over the real.<br/><br/>The newly formed Doom Patrol is forced to come together to stop this.<br/><br/>I'm loving it so far although the art is OK and some panels can a little 2edgy5me.<br/><br/><b>Spoilers for the first 4 issues of Grant Morrison's Doom Patrol</b><br/><br/>Let's talk about an example of this edgyness:<br/><br/>The Doom Patrol find themselves caught within the memetic fictional city of Orqwith that's the main culprit of the first 4 issues of the run.<br/><br/>We learn that this city was created by still living authors and philosophers who built a logical killswitch within it. When pulled, it will disrupt the internal logical consistency of Orqwith and thus destroy it.<br/><br/>Eventually Rebis flies over to the cathedral at the center of the city with two Zen Koan-esque pope figures, one who lies and the other only tells the truth.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781401263126/p103.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""308"" /><br/><br/>Rebis then engages in logical debate with these two logic popes and eventually triggering their killswitch.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781401263126/p104.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""307"" /><br/><br/>Reading these pages, I could hear the sound of vuvuzelas blasting and see Rebis taking off only to put his dark shades back on while the cathedral blows up behind him in slow motion.<br/><br/>It's not edgy exactly. I'm not sure what it is exactly. It feels a little tropey, maybe comic booky?<br/><br/>Moments like this, big theoretically awesome panels, are spread throughout the Incal as well but the ones in Doom Patrol aren't hitting as hard or as smoothly as the ones in the Incal for some reason.<br/><br/>TBD",1

Fables is explicitly an allegory for the Isreal-Palestinian conflict. So I'm expecting more than a little yikes with a dash of Islamophobia in this comic book so let's see how far we get.<br/><br/>1 volume into it so far and I'm curious to see what happens next. It's nice to read through a comic book that, so far, is much more compressed than the Berserk manga I just finished. We're not luxuriating in chapter after chapter of every single movement a guy makes as he's slicing through a horde of demons. Instead, in Fables, and American comics more broadly, we zoom in on interesting scenes and skip over the details.<br/><br/>There's a place for both compressed and decompressed art depicting moments in time like comic books and manga. But after reading through 41 volumes of hyper decompressed manga, I need a break!",1
9781593070205,2024/08/10,fiction graphic-novel fantasy horror read,read,1,4,"Berserk is a gritty medieval fantasy manga by Kentaro Miura, who may have been one of the greatest artists ever. His art will absolutely floor you time and time again.<br/><br/>The story of Berserk has its ups and downs, but overall I was left disappointed by it. The story feels like a vehicle that constantly thrusts Guts and his crew into contact with the Eldritch and Demonic horrors that Miura excels at drawing. That's great but it's usually not much more than that.<br/><br/>A lot of mysteries and ideas are dropped for effect or as cliffhangers and then completely forgotten as the series goes on. This is the curse of long-running serialized manga and it's something you'll have to deal with if you want to read Berserk.<br/><br/>Random thoughts below:<br/><br/>Oddly enough, a lot of the mercenary captain stuff reminded me of Mary Gentle's Ash: A Secret History. <br/>--- <br/><br/>I'm about 6/41 volumes into the story right now and I'm enjoying it much more than the One Piece chapters I read earlier this year (or last?). The art is leagues better and the story is much more interesting but we'll see where it goes from here.<br/><br/><b>Big spoilers for Berserk to follow</b><br/><br/>What do I love about Berserk so far (20/41 volumes into)?<br/><br/>The art is the best art I've over seen in a manga. The attention to detail, the emotion, the motion. It's all fantastic.<br/><br/>I also like the story generally.<br/><br/>What don't I like?<br/><br/>Casca getting graped so hard she gets fridged and goes fully pretarded. Guts goes through a similar trauma as a child (although not to the same extent if we want compare them) but he pushes past it as best he can while Casca is completely destroyed by it. It feels a little gratuitous although Griffith being completely broken by a year of torture followed his grape of Casca makes sense if we buy into the ""Griffith is gay for Guts"" angle.<br/><br/>The Lost Children Arc feels like filler and is a little reminder that this is a serialized manga and that the artist's art style, while being the BEST, is probably not sustainable in the long run due to the level of detail in each panel.<br/><br/>The Male Gaze present in the novel, Casca's agency being taken away is made worst by panels lingering on her body and fixated on its weakness and the constant threat of her grape.<br/><br/>Comparing Casca's fragility to Guts, Guts gets hurt constantly but he always gets back up again especially with the help of Puck's fairy dust. But you can't sprinkle fairy dust on Casca's psychological trauma I guess.<br/><br/>It seems like an anti-chosen one story which suffers from similar problems to a chosen one story. Fate and prophecy (and determinism?) play a role in fueling this idea that the suffering of Guts is inevitable and nothing can be done about it. ""The Current of Causality"" is a constant refrain spoken by the Skeleton King that perhaps is meant to communicate both the truth of our inability to change our fate and the futility of fighting against it.<br/><br/>The use of Skeleton Knight Ex Machina a bunch of times gets a little old. Considering the forces Guts is fighting against, it makes sense that he would need a powerful ally in that fight if we want to see him survive. But the Skeleton Knight's motives are unclear and his actions feel unearned at times.",1

9781643377803,,currently-reading fiction graphic-novel science-fiction,currently-reading,0,,"Drawn by French artist Moebius and written by Jodorowsky himself, every page of the Incal is an opportunity for the pair to blow you away with the prettiest art you'll ever see and a humongous story told at a pace that's unbelievably fast considering its scope.<br/><br/>Watching Jodorowsky's Dune changed me. It's a documentary about Alejandro Joderowsky's famous, failed, attempt to adapt Frank Herbert's Dune into a movie. The documentary brings to light a sort of crazed artistry that Jodorowsky seems to possess and is compelled to bring forth into the world. Ever since I've been curious to look into his work, I'm glad I finally did.<br/><br/>It seems like The Incal is where a lot of his unspent creative energy went into after his Dune adaptation failed to materialize.<br/><br/>I think the world is better for it. THIS COMIC IS SO GOOD.<br/><br/>There's a lot to love in the Incal but what's blown me away more than anything is how big the scope of the comic is combined with how committed it is to delivering a truly epic tale as efficiently and as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>I'm convinced that with the Incal Jodorowsky and Moebius's shared goal was to blow the reader's mind with every single panel, and failing to do that with every single page.<br/><br/>The journey of John Difool is fast. There's no time wasting, because there's no time to waste. John Difool is being pushed and pulled around by the titular Incal, a powerful object who's purpose is gradually revealed throughout the text, into contact with characters that are as big, metaphorically, as you can imagine and into scenes that are at their best life changing and at their worst extremely exciting.<br/><br/>All the while the universe John Difool exists in is imploding in on itself as galactic empires fight for control of the universe, the underclass riot in an attempt to overthrow aristocrats, the technopope and his techno-techno followers build a gigantic black egg that is more than a little ominous... I could go on.<br/><br/>It's fucking insanity. How can someone read the Incal and not spend their entire life telling everyone they know, maybe everyone full stop, to read it.<br/><br/>It's like a real the King in Yellow kind of situation, or at least it should be.",1
