Chain-Gang All-Stars is NOT one of these kinds of novels. Everything is political but Chain-Gang All-Stars is aggressively so.<br/><br/>The text forces you to think about the topics mentioned above among others, in great detail, and it can be quite depressing. But the premise combined with its execution and the inspirations the text is pulling from act as a lubricant to provide the reader with both a very hard to put down read as well as some deeply upsetting knowledge about how the US oppresses marginalized people.<br/><br/>I was fully immersed in the world presented to me. Adjei-Brenyah's depictions of these dystopian gladiator fights are written such that it's easy to feel like a spectactor in the arena watching these fights from afar, cheering on your favorite contender and cringing when the fight gets bloody.<br/><br/>I felt like I could hear the crowd chanting all around me.<br/><br/><b>Mel—</b><br/><b>Her left foot fell first, the midsole landed, and she rolled purposefully to her toes before pushing off again. Her body remembered, would always remember, how to run with purpose.</b><br/><b>—an—</b><br/><b>Again, her arms reversed themselves, slipping precisely past each other as her right leg rose and fell, her stride opening still. She was very close. She thought of nothing, put her trust in her body as it sped forward.</b><br/><b>—cholia</b><br/><b>Her arms switchbladed and her legs carried. She continued the push and switch of her arms and legs, forging speed. Her body told her, This speed, me, your body is your weapon.</b><br/><br/>As we get to know the gladiators more personally, what they have to go through to get where they are and why, it becomes harder to read these fights as unproblematic entertainment. It becomes clear that what these fights actually are, which is private capital funded public executions of society's ""undesirables"" for profit.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/ohno.gif"" width=""200"" height=""100"" /><br/><br/>Other than the initial premise, there's a lot to love in Chain-Gang All-Stars, let's talk about it.<br/><br/>Adjei-Brenyah is an expert at perspective shifting. The story is told from the perspective of many different characters and the way the narrative voice shifts between them is masterful. Initially, it's unclear how all of these characters will fit into the larger narrative. Slowly figuring out how they would eventually collide was quite rewarding.<br/><br/><b>We still resting now. I lie down near enough to the others, fall on a bed of grass. The clothes I wear simple but clean. I used one of my murder points to have a brand I never heard of clean my clothes for me each week. Death becomes laundry. Death becomes food. Death the currency of everything if you let it. And they let it. But since it's there I use it and I have a black shirt and pants to train in and sneakers that fit me and socks and underwear that all smell like pine and soap and the sweat of the March.</b><br/><br/>For a book that has so many characters in it, I'm surprised by how many of them I ended up caring about. Wil and Emily were a particular highlight for me; watching this couple live vicariously through the blood sport content they were consuming was a real pleasure.<br/><br/><b>""What the fuck just happened, babe? What the fuck just fucking happened. Oh my fucking God."" Emily had been bingeing recorded streams again. Wil had wanted to be there when she saw this part so she'd watched with him.</b><br/><br/>The novel has an early 2010s young adult framing that I associate with series like The Hunger Games, yet, the characters are all adults and the text is forcing you to come face to face with the grim reality of living as a marginalized person in the United States constantly.<br/><br/>It's a vibe.<br/><br/>And, to be clear, there's little to no escapism to find here if that's what you're looking for.<br/><br/>Despite writing a near future sci-fi text, Adjei-Brenyah keeps the reader grounded in the reality they live in by regularly presenting them with footnotes, contextually revealing real life statistics or stories about the US's prison-industrial complex, sexual violence, etc. I've never seen footnotes used quite like this in any of the fiction I've read, it's unique.<br/><br/><b>There's a bed and a shit tin. Dark in here most of the day. But they glow in my brain. The hole is black. I only see when the door opens. The door opens one time a day. I sit, sleep, sing, flex, breathe, stretch, shake, cough, shit here. Here is where I come apart.[1]</b><br/><b>1: Solitary confinement has been consistently found, nationally and internationally, to induce anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, depression, panic attacks, memory loss, and other cognitive defects.</b><br/><br/>Footnotes are also used to provide poetic epitaphs for almost every person who dies. I thought this was a nice touch, giving Adjei-Brenyah the opportunity to pay respects to characters who've been killed and allow him to make these moments more impactful by reminding the reader of who these characters were and who they could have become if their lives weren't cut short.<br/><br/><b>[...] Seen a lot. Done a lot. Found a home in the hell. She never sold poison to kids, but the poison found the kids anyways, so what was the difference? If you don't have a code you have nothing, and [...] had a code. You swing for your family, you hold your head high, you try to do right when you can. She didn't think she was the love type. She was wrong about that. She found it in hell, a home with love and singing.</b><br/><br/>Chain-Gang All-Stars doesn't provide the reader with all the answers they might be craving for by the end. There's story threads that are left unwoven, but it feels like this was done intentionally. An ending that solved every problem presented in the novel would feel cheap and unearned.<br/><br/>There's no easy solution to breaking down systems of oppression but with the right effort applied by the right people we can change the world and make it a better place to live in for all of us.<br/><br/>Chain-Gang All-Stars has got a lot of real depressing stuff in it but it's also a hopeful story that's about doing the best we can given the circumstances we've been forced into, it's about found family, it's about forgiveness and about loving yourself no matter what.<br/><br/><b>""I learned a long time ago. On this one thing you don't negotiate. You love through all the people you've been and hope you have a chance at being better."" [...] ""What I'm telling you is you can curse yourself to the moon and back and what will it have you feeling like? But try to look at yourself and say 'I love you' and see what happens.""</b><br/><br/>It's pretty good y'all.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/bye.gif"" width=""200"" height=""133"" />",1

'She had me dressed up in a suit, toting a gun and shooting at toy missiles which ""explosively dismantled"" themselves.'<br/><br/>'You didn't enjoy it.'<br/><br/>'Not at all. I had high hopes for that girl, but too much of that sort of nonsense and I think her intelligence will explosively dismantle.'<br/><br/>'Well, such diversions aren't for everybody. She was just trying to be helpful. You'd said you were feeling restless, looking for something new.'<br/><br/>'Well, that wasn't it,' Gurgeh said, and felt suddenly, inexplicably, saddened.<br/><br/></b><br/><b>'All reality is a game. Physics at its most fundamental, the very fabric of our universe, results directly from the interaction of certain fairly simple rules, and chance; the same description may be applied to the best, most elegant and both intellectually and aesthetically satisfying games. By being unknowable, by resulting from events which, at the sub-atomic level, cannot be fully predicted, the future remains malleable, and retains the possibility of change, the hope of coming to prevail; victory, to use an unfashionable word. In this, the future is a game; time is one of the rules. Generally, all the best mechanistic games - those which can be played in any sense ""perfectly"", such as grid, Prallian scope, 'nkraytle, chess, Farnic dimensions - can be traced to civilisations lacking a relativistic view of the universe (let alone the reality). They are also, I might add, invariably pre-machine sentience societies.<br/><br/>'The very first-rank games acknowledge the element of chance, even if they rightly restrict raw luck. To attempt to construct a game on any other lines, no matter how complicated and subtle the rules are, and regardless of the scale and differentiation of the playing volume and the variety of the powers and attributes of the pieces, is inevitably to shackle oneself to a conspectus which is not merely socially but techno-philosophically lagging several ages behind our own. As a historical exercise it might have some value. As a work of the intellect, it's just a waste of time. If you want to make something old-fashioned, why not build a wooden sailing boat, or a steam engine? They're just as complicated and demanding as a mechanistic game, and you'll keep fit at the same time.'</b><br/><b>The game went on. People came and went around him. The web held all his fortune; the little spheres, holding their secret treasures and threats, became like discrete parcels of life and death, single points of probability which could be guessed at but never known until they were challenged, opened, looked at. All reality seemed to hinge on those infinitesimal bundles of meaning.</b><br/><b>Three days passed. He couldn't settle to anything. He tried to read papers, old books, the material of his own he'd been working on - but on every occasion he found himself reading and re-reading the same piece or page or screen, time and time again, trying hard to take it in but finding his thoughts constantly veering away from the words and diagrams and illustrations in front of him, refusing to absorb anything, going back time and time again to the same treadmill, the same looping, tail-swallowing, eternally pointless round of questioning and regret. Why had he done it? What way out was there?</b><br/><b>'Jernau Gurgeh,' the machine said, making a sighing noise, 'a guilty system recognises no innocents. As with any power apparatus which thinks everybody's either for it or against it, we're against it. You would be too, if you thought about it. The very way you think places you amongst its enemies. This might not be your fault, because every society imposes some of its values on those raised within it, but the point is that some societies try to maximise that effect, and some try to minimise it. You come from one of the latter and you're being asked to explain yourself to one of the former. Prevarication will be more difficult than you might imagine; neutrality is probably impossible. You cannot choose not to have the politics you do; they are not some separate set of entities somehow detachable from the rest of your being; they are a function of your existence. I know that and they know that; you had better accept it.'</b><br/><b><br/><br/>'I think I see Shohobohaum Za in the crowd,' the drone said as they waited at the exit. Ram's entourage was still cluttering the far end of the ribbon of path held clear by the two lines of policemen.<br/><br/>Gurgeh glanced at the machine, then down the line of arm-linked police. He was still tensed from the game, bloodstream suffused with multifarious chemicals. As happened every now and again, everything he saw around him seemed to be part of the game; the way people stood like pieces, grouped according to who could take or affect whom; the way the pattern on the marquee was like a simple grid-area on the board, and the poles like planted power-sources waiting to replenish some exhausted minor piece and supporting a crux-point in the game; the way the people and police stood like the suddenly closed jaws of some nightmarish pincer-movement… all was the game, everything was seen in its light, translated into the combative imagery of its language, evaluated in the context its structure imposed upon the mind.</b><br/><b>Anyway, he was awash with a bitter-sweet flood of new and enhanced emotions; the terror of risk and possible defeat, the sheer exultation of the gamble that paid off and the campaign which triumphed; the horror of suddenly seeing a weakness in his position which could lose him the game; the surge of relief when nobody else noticed and there was time to plug the gap; the pulse of furious, gloating glee when he saw such a weakness in another's game; and the sheer unbridled joy of victory.</b><br/><b>Gurgeh saw many cripples. They sat on street corners, selling trinkets, playing music on scratchy, squeaky instruments, or just begging. Some were blind, some had no arms, some had no legs. Gurgeh looked at the damaged people and felt dizzy; the gritty surface of the street beneath him seemed to tip and heave. For a moment it was as though the city, the planet, the whole Empire swirled around him in a frantic spinning tangle of nightmare shapes; a constellation of suffering and anguish, an infernal dance of agony and mutilation.</b><br/><b>The drone made a sighing noise. The man was still staring at the dead screen. 'That's it,' the drone said. 'I'm sorry if what I've shown you has upset you, Jernau Gurgeh, but I didn't want you to leave here thinking the Empire was just a few venerable game-players, some impressive architecture and a few glorified night-clubs. What you've seen tonight is also what it's about. And there's plenty in between that I can't show you; all the frustrations that affect the poor and the relatively well-off alike, caused simply because they live in a society where one is not free to do as one chooses. There's the journalist who can't write what he knows is the truth, the doctor who can't treat somebody in pain because they're the wrong sex… a million things every day, things that aren't as melodramatic and gross as what I've shown you, but which are still part of it, still some of the effects.<br/><br/>'The ship told you a guilty system recognises no innocents. I'd say it does. It recognises the innocence of a young child, for example, and you saw how they treated that. In a sense it even recognises the ""sanctity"" of the body… but only to violate it. Once again, Gurgeh, it all boils down to ownership, possession; about taking and having.' Flere-Imsaho paused, then floated towards Gurgeh, came very close to him. 'Ah, but I'm preaching again, aren't I? The excesses of youth. I've kept you up late. Maybe you're ready for some sleep now; it's been a long night, hasn't it? I'll leave you.' It turned and floated away. It stopped near the door again. 'Good night,' it said.</b><br/><b>'Good,' Hamin nodded. 'You see, Gurgeh, one can be on either side in the Empire. One can be the player, or one can be… played upon.' Hamin smiled at what was a play on words in Eächic, and to some extent in Marain too.</b><br/><b>Gurgeh watched Groasnachek as it fell away beneath them. The city tilted as he was thrown back into his seat; the whole view swung and juddered as the shuttlecraft powered into the hazy skies.<br/><br/>Gradually all the patterns and the shapes came out, revealed for a while before the increasing distance, the city's own vapours, dust and grime, and the altering angle of their climb took it all away.<br/><br/>For all the jumble, it looked momentarily peaceful and ordered in its parts. The distance made its individual, local confusions and dislocations disappear, and from a certain height, where little ever dallied, and almost everything just passed through, it looked exactly like a great, mindless, spreading organism.</b><br/><b><br/><br/>So far so average. Our game-player's lucked out again. I guess you can see he's a changed man, though. These humans! I'm going to be consistent, however. I haven't told you who I am so far, and I'm not going to tell you now, either. Maybe later.<br/><br/>Maybe.<br/><br/>Does identity matter anyway? I have my doubts. We are what we do, not what we think. Only the interactions count (there is no problem with free will here; that's not incompatible with believing your actions define you). And what is free will anyway? Chance. The random factor. If one is not ultimately predictable, then of course that's all it can be. I get so frustrated with people who can't see this!<br/><br/>Even a human should be able to understand it's obvious.<br/><br/>The result is what matters, not how it's achieved (unless, of course, the process of achieving is itself a series of results). What difference does it make whether a mind's made up of enormous, squidgy, animal cells working at the speed of sound (in air!), or from a glittering nanofoam of reflectors and patterns of holographic coherence, at lightspeed? (Let's not even think about a Mind mind.) Each is a machine, each is an organism, each fulfils the same task.<br/><br/>Just matter, switching energy of one sort or another.<br/><br/>Switches. Memory. The random element that is chance and that is called choice: common denominators, all.<br/><br/>I say again; you is what you done. Dynamic (mis)behaviourism, that's my creed.<br/><br/>Gurgeh? His switches are working funny. He's thinking differently, acting uncharacteristically. He is a different person. He's seen the worst that meatgrinder of a city could provide, and he just took it personally, and took his revenge.<br/><br/>Now he's spaceborne again, head crammed full of Azad rules, his brain adapted and adapting to the swirling, switching patterns of that seductive, encompassing, feral set of rules and possibilities, and being carted through space towards the Empire's most creakily symbolic shrine: Echronedal; the place of the standing wave of flame; the Fire Planet.<br/><br/>But will our hero prevail? Can he possibly prevail? And what would constitute winning, anyway?<br/><br/>How much has the man still got to learn? What will he make of such knowledge? More to the point, what will it make of him?<br/><br/>Wait and see. It'll work itself out, in time.<br/><br/>Take it from there, maestro…<br/><br/></b><br/><b>Gurgeh dived back into the game, an amphibian into welcomingwater. For a few moves he just gloried in the feeling of returning hometo his element and the sheer joy of the contest, taking delight in aflexing of his strengths and powers, the readying tension of the piecesand places; then he curved out from that playing to the seriousbusiness of the building and the hunting, the making and linking andthe destroying and cutting; the searching and destroying.<br/><br/>The board became both Culture and Empire again. The setting wasmade by them both; a glorious, beautiful, deadly killing field,unsurpassably fine and sweet and predatory and carved from Nicosar'sbeliefs and his together. Image of their minds; a hologram of purecoherence, burning like a standing wave of fire across the board, aperfect map of the landscapes of thought and faith within their heads.<br/><br/>He began the slow move that was defeat and victory together beforehe even knew it himself. Nothing so subtle, so complex, so beautifulhad ever been seen on an Azad board. He believed that; he knew that.He would make it the truth.<br/><br/>The game went on.<br/><br/>Breaks, days, evenings, conversations, meals; they came and went inanother dimension; a monochrome thing, a flat, grainy image.

I'm not sure it's something in-between either, I don't really know what it is. It's OK, I guess?<br/><br/>I didn't hate it but I didn't find it to be very interesting. Compared to <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2024-05-03"">The Autistic Experience by Joe James and Marie-Laure Del Vecchio</a>, Annie Kotowicz's What I Mean When I Say I'm Autistic lacks the breadth of experience to make it feel like it matters.<br/><br/>Annie Kotowicz's self-reflection and thoughts on her experience of being Autistic, although important to her and those around her, feel like a drop in the pond compared to the 80+ Autistic voices that were featured in The Autistic Experience.<br/><br/>I'm sure the text was a great writing exercise for Annie Kotowicz and I'd love to do something similar for myself. But I question how relevant it is for people other than Annie Kotowicz, her fairy tale boyfriend Jake (this man is either A. not real B. a one in a billion catch C. he kills kids and it's all a facade) or people close to Annie Kotowicz.<br/><br/>For a text that is so focused on one person's experience of being Autistic, I would have expected some more detail about that experience. I would love to know what it felt like to be Annie Kotowicz in those moments where her being Autistic led to real conflict so that I could connect to her on a deeper level.<br/><br/>Annie Kotowicz does talk about moments from her life like this but they're written in such a way that makes her and me as the reader feel so far removed from these events that they're very hard to relate to. It's really hard to relate to the list of behaviors, symptoms and coping mechanisms that the rest of the book can be reduced to at times.<br/><br/>What I Mean When I Say I'm Autistic also doesn't serve as more comprehensive primer on Autism that someone could read and be guided onto a path of self-discovery because of how specific the text is to Annie Kotowicz's experience (the section on Musicals for example, demonstrates this specificity quite well). If you're looking for a more general book on Autism, check out <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2022-06-01"">Understanding Autism In Adults And Aging Adults by Theresa Regan</a>. I was hoping for Annie Kotowicz to provide me with a shorter, perhaps more compelling ""primer"" on autism, but I definitely didn't get that.<br/><br/>Long story short, I didn't like this text very much. I was expecting something else which I didn't get, so after reading it, I was left feeling a little confused. This is a shame because there are quite a few chapters that have concise, compelling and particularly poignant views on the Autistic experience that deserve to be in a better book.<br/><br/>I might be able to be convinced to read other work by Annie Kotowicz but this book really didn't do it for me.",1
