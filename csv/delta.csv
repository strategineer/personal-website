Empathy porn. Check.<br/><br/>I might enjoy Dogs of War more than Children of Time? It's more efficient and covers many of the same themes with many more interesting characters.<br/><br/>There's a lot to love in Dogs of War but Rex is the star that everything great in the book revolves around.<br/><br/>Rex is a dog Bioform, a cybernetic bio-engineered lifeform made from both dog and human DNA. Him and his kind were built as better, stronger, faster and, most importantly, more obedient replacements for human soldiers (the military-industrial complex tried to build fully autonomous robots prior to developing Bioforms but that didn't end very well).<br/><br/>A chip in Rex's brain feeds him the right kind of brain chemicals when he's a ""Good Dog"" and the bad kind of chemicals when he's being a ""Bad Dog"" which is how his Master trains Rex and his fellow Bioforms to do as their told. Right from page 1, it's clear that Rex and his squad of Bioforms are being used to commit heinous war crimes (yikes) but aren't aware that what they're doing is wrong.<br/><br/>Rex's ability to reason, understand morality and the world around him is relatively low at the start of the book. With the help of his friend Honey, an exceptionally smart Bioform bear, Rex, throughout the book, manages to expand his consciousness, eventually breaking the chain between him and his Master and leading his own life, free from the collar.<br/><br/>Getting to see this transformation and its impact on the rest of the world from Rex's POV is fantastic. A lot of effort was put into gradually changing Rex's way of thinking throughout the book and having that change be reflected in the prose. It's really well done.<br/><br/>Dogs of War has many characters other than Rex but he's the star of the show. If you like Adrian Tchaikovsky's work, don't miss out on this one.",1

Also, there's SuperTrump who's using his infinite charisma to put chips in people's brains to get them to comply with anything and everything he wants (yikes).<br/><br/>That's Bear Head.<br/><br/>A standalone-ish sequel to Dogs of War. Taking place a few decades after the events of the first book, the world has begun to turn its back on Bioforms and Distributed Intelligences leaving Honey, HumOS and our lovable lawyer Aslan (also, Bees kind of) in the middle of all of it.<br/><br/>Walter S. Thompson (AKA SuperTrump), and his PA Springer, is using his power to put chips into people's brains to get them to comply with his will.<br/><br/>And then there's our bio-engineered human, Jimmy, who left Earth in hopes of finding a better life on Mars (I don't think he did).<br/><br/>There's A LOT to unpack here, and a lot of POVs. The POV gimmick of Bear Head is cool with Jimmy and Honey's sentient personality upload occupying the same headspace (literally) and the story being told from his perspective and then hers. Also, Honey's personality upload gradually ""coming to life"" by unraveling Honey's memories to learn who she was and who she is now is great. But, it's not as compelling or unique as Rex's POV in Dogs of War.<br/><br/>The two beings in one head gimmick is really cool though (it's so much better than <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-11/"">Arkady Martine's execution of a similar concept in her Teixcalaan series</a>) but it's impossible for someone as skilled as Adrian Tchaikovsky to keep one upping himself constantly.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Bear Head quite a bit but not as much as Dogs of War. The chapters told from the perspective of Thompson's PA Springer are not as much of a highlight as the Jimmy and Honey chapters. Her perspective is important and usually adds to the overall narrative but we spend a bit too much time with her, repeating the same themes over and over again. Very early on you get the impression that Thompson is the devil incarnate, spending more time following his story doesn't really do anything to deepen that past the first few chapters.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Dogs of War, you'll likely want to read Bear Head and get quite a lot out of it but don't expect it to reach that same high.",1
