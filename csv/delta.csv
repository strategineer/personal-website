Sign me up.<br/><br/>spoilers-ish for the basic premise:<br/><br/><spoiler>This book focuses on childhood trauma and how our memories of the past deteriorate over time naturally and sometimes change completely because our brain suppresses traumatic memories we can't handle.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure how this process works but it's real and tough to deal with because two people can remember the same event very differently and how do we handle that?<br/><br/>This book takes this premise to an extreme but the malleability of memories are a universal human struggle that the author is playing with in interesting ways in this novel that I really enjoyed sinking my teeth into.</spoiler><br/><br/>A well-executed novel that does what it sets out to do and engages with themes surrounding suppressed traumatic memories which are particularly poignant for me right now.<br/><br/>Also it's a breeze to read through and doesn't waste your time which I appreciated.,1

But I couldn't help myself.<br/><br/>This book is a list of tips and tricks about Game Mastering --- it's packed with references you probably won't understand, misogynist art and sentences that will send you straight into an existential crisis in which you spiral into despair asking yourself why someone would ever put these words on a page.<br/><br/>The book begins with the author stating that, initially, this guide was meant for his eyes only. I think it should have stayed that way. This book is similar to something like the F.A.T.A.L. RPG in that it's an artifact produced by an older cishet white male tabletop roleplaying community which seems to have a very particular idea of what tabletop roleplaying is and should be --- by writing extensively about their thoughts on the subject, they reveal the extent of their morally bankrupt ideology for everyone to see.<br/><br/>Here's a quote from the section titled ""Pretty Woman"" --- keep in mind, this is just the tip of the iceberg:<br/><br/><blockquote>Indeed, sexy women make the world go round. Without going overboard, pepper your campaign with exquisite curves, creamy thighs, and delicate ruby-red mouths. Seduce the players with her physical attractiveness. Compare her to a famous celebrity like Megan Fox or Kristen Bell. Better yet, come prepared with a picture of some unknown woman from the internet or evocative piece of RPG art.</blockquote><br/><br/>My god.",1

9781668092651,2024/12/06,read romance science-fiction thriller tournament-of-books-2025,read,1,5,"A woman working for the Ministry of Time is tasked with helping assimilate a sailor pulled through time, who more than a hundred years prior was on a doomed Arctic expedition and would have died otherwise. Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>I didn't know anything about the Ministry of Time before picking it up and reading it other than it being in contention for the Best Novel of 2024 in certain circles (at least that's what I had understood prior to picking it up).<br/><br/>I ""get"" it. It's an ambitious novel that succeeds at combining multiple genres that usually don't mix in a way that <i>really</i> works.<br/><br/>Kaliane Bradley's The Ministry of Time is something like three parts romance, one part thriller, one part historical fiction and one part science fiction. At its heart, it's a romance. There's the constant longing and desire expressed by the protagonist and the ""will they won't they"" throughline that is used to prop up all the other genre tropes Bradley is masterfully juggling.<br/><br/>What surprised me most about The Ministry of Time was the tone. It's vulgar, it's funny, it's sarcastic... In a way that feels natural to me that I don't often see in the novels I read.<br/><br/>Kaliane Bradley, and the narrator in The Ministry of Time, is a ""passing"" mixed race person raised by an immigrant mother displaced from her country and her people. This is relevant to my experience of reading through the novel because it comes up a lot in the text and because this is also my lived experience.<br/><br/>I can't say that Bradley's portrayal of this ""sexy AF sailor plucked straight from the Victorian era"" speaks to me in <b>that</b> way but there's a lot in the Ministry of Time that does. And, it seems obvious to me that this is partially because Bradley, the narrator and I all share this common history of immigrant mothers and how important it is to our understanding who we are, where we belong and how we interact with the world.<br/><br/>It's good, it's entertaining and I feel comfortable boosting the signal of the Ministry of Time in my own little way because of how well it portrays a lived experience of mine that I've never been able to put into words. Seeing parts of that experience expressed in this work that's doing so many other impressive things warms my heart.<br/><br/>Although, I wonder what Bradley's next novel will look like considering that she's obviously self-inserted parts of herself (in a very fan fiction-y way) into the text, as the narrator. What will her next protagonist look like?",1

Wild Dice encourage players to let their characters do things that they aren't necessarily good at (especially if it's good roleplaying, which might get them a Benny) because they're more likely to succeed and much less likely to critically fail (requiring snake eyes, which has at worst a 1/24 chance of occurring and at best 1/72) than in other roleplaying games (think DnD).<br/>- It actually does support any kind of setting you can come up with --- it just works.
