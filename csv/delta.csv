Summoning a mythological lion (God? a god?) and having it lick the protagonist in what seems to be a historical medieval fantasy story was pretty wild. Starting a book with a violent rape of a child followed by her murdering both of her assailants was wild. I don't know what I was expecting from this text before reading it but it wasn't this.</spoiler><br/><br/>200 pages in<br/><br/><spoiler>like wtf is going on here. The mix and match between extremely grounded medieval historical fiction and the fantasy is cool. <br/><br/>I LOVE a good frame story. The historian losing his shit over previously historical documents being categorized as fiction is great. Some real Knights Templar / AssCreed shit, conspiracy shit. <br/><br/>That's cool but then Ash's story cool AF with a healthy dose rollercoaster ride action sequences, suspense, surprises, intrigue, all wrapped in what feels like an authentic-ish medieval war story told from an interesting POV.</spoiler><br/><br/>400 pages in<br/><br/><spoiler>I am continuing to be amazed by Mary Gentle's ability to combine the mundane reality of running a mercenary company in the late 1400s with the fantasy scenes of 500 priests praying and manifesting a blizzard, a Jewish curse making the Sun disappear from an entire part of the world, Ash's ability to communicate with, essentially, a computer versed in military tactics.<br/><br/>The mundanity makes the fantastic more believable somehow. <br/><br/>Also, Ash is not a stereotypical protagonist. Mary Gentle consistently subverts some of the tropes you might expect to see throughout the text. Ash is not a chosen one, she's special in some ways but not in others.<br/><br/>Initially she is portrayed as being a chosen one of some kind and touched by God, a prophet of battle of sorts. But gradually this shifts as our understanding of the world Ash exists in is deepened. My perception of her shifted and made me think that Ash isn't special or fated to achieve great things because she's touched by God, she's just a product of her upbringing and her genes.<br/><br/>But that understanding of Ash clashes with the fantastical elements present within the book which might lead us to believe that this world has one or more beings of great power, gods of some sort, that act on the world as we know it and who's power can't be fully comprehended by the people affected by it.<br/><br/>Or is it just a story within a story? What parts of Ash's story can we believe to be true within the context of the novel when we're told that the historian who's translating the text is telling us that he's watching his archeologist friend unearthing stone golems as described in the novel.<br/><br/>And does it matter?<br/><br/>Whether Ash was licked by a godlike blue lion in her childhood or not, does it matter? Whether Ash is real or not, does it matter?<br/><br/>To be clear she's not real, but that DOESN'T matter.<br/><br/>The entire text is a defense of fiction as a medium and as a fantastic way to express truth about the world we live in and the lives we live. <br/><br/></spoiler>",1

Reading through Tomie has made that abundantly clear to me.<br/><br/>Tomie would be a better work if you removed all of the text and just left the art. I'm not joking, I'm 100% serious.<br/><br/>Uzumaki, Junji Ito's more known (for good reason) work, succeeds where Tomie fails. Uzumaki has an overarching story that ties all (well, most) of its chapters together. Thematically, a town that's cursed by spirals is more interesting and less politically fraught than a girl who gets murdered by an entire class of students who is then cursed to continue being murdered over and over again, forever. Uzumaki has main characters that you follow throughout the story that you actually care and worry about, Tomie doesn't really.<br/><br/>Just read Uzumaki, no matter how much of a fan you are of Junji Ito's art, I don't think having to read through Tomie is worth it.",1
