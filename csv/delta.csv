It's not meant to entertain, it's meant to inform. Although, if learning everything there is to know about Greek myths sounds entertaining to you then this is the book for you.<br/><br/>I've always been fascinated by Greek mythology but my understanding of it came from the sanitized stories I read in D'Aulaires Book Of Greek Myths and secondhand from the many modern interpretations of the myths I had seen throughout my life.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/d_aulaires_book_of_greek_myths.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""542"" /><br/><br/>Prior to reading this book, I had never really taken the time to dive deep into Greek mythology.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did because now I cringe thinking about all the times I said that I prefer Greek mythology to Christianity because it's: ""way funner"".<br/><br/>I mean, in some ways, it is buuuuuuut also Zeus rapes a lot (they don't really talk about that in d'Aulaires illustrated book for kids)...<br/><br/>If you want to learn about every single Greek myth that exists, then you should read this book. Otherwise, you should stay far far away from it.",1
