""You've probably seen a lot of Aandrisks naked before.""<br/><br/>""Yes, but . . . Sissix, the flexibility on this guy, holy shit—"" She stuck her hand toward a bowl of vegetables. Dr. Chef smacked her wrist with a spatula without even glancing her way.<br/><br/>Sissix sighed.

""Honestly, would one day of being polite have killed you?""<br/><br/>""Hey, I'm polite,"" Jenks said. ""I didn't even mention Prison Planet 7.""</blockquote><br/><br/>I picked this book up after being disappointed with <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780765389121/"">John Scalzi's The Kaiju Preservation Society</a>. It's a boring novel but the way John Scalzi fumbles his handling of ""woke"" themes is pathetic.<br/><br/>Having read <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781473647688/"">The Galaxy, and the Ground Within by Becky Chambers</a> last year and having enjoyed it, I knew that she was interested in and skilled at telling empathetic stories about diverse people, each of them being unique, special in their own way and, most importantly, deserving of love. She tells hopeful stories without shying away from ""real"" issues that don't have easy solutions which makes the happy moments feel more earned.<br/><br/>This is the kind of story I was looking to read and Becky Chambers nailed it. She excels at depicting characters, human and nonhuman alike, in a way that makes it impossible to not empathize with them. And, by doing so, she's able to put her characters in a variety of situations, from the mundane to the exciting and tense, and no matter what the stakes are, I consistently found myself at the edge of my seat with my heart and soul laid bare, ready to feel and interpret the emotional beats that Becky Chambers was laying down.<br/><br/><blockquote>""Thank you,"" Ashby said, though the AI was still speaking. He led the crew away from the booth. Jenks remained behind.<br/><br/>The AI continued on, unfazed by the departure of its audience. ""Location indicators come in models fit for all species, and can provide alerts in a variety of sensory inputs, such as smell, taste, sound, dermal stimulation, neural stimulation—""<br/><br/>""Is Jenks coming?"" Rosemary asked.<br/><br/>""Jenks always waits until the end of the speech,"" Kizzy said with a fond smile. ""Just to be polite.""<br/><br/>Rosemary looked back to the jittery AI. ""That's not a sentient model, is it?""<br/><br/>""I don't think so,"" said Ashby. ""But try telling Jenks that. He always gives AIs the benefit of the doubt.""</blockquote><br/><br/>Sure, there's a galactic federation and universe-spanning political stuff happening. But none of that matters until the moment it impacts the characters's lives (Nothing happens in a vacuum hehe). The characters are the frame through which we see the entire universe of the novel and I love it because Becky Chambers's characters are so vibrant and easy to love.<br/><br/>This focus on character is fantastic to read because Becky Chambers is so good at it. I'd think that more authors (<i>cough</i> John Scalzi <i>cough</i>) would be interested in writing this kind of character-centric story if they could. But I don't think it's that easy even though Becky Chambers makes it look like it is.<br/><br/>I'm dead set on reading more of Becky Chambers's work and you can expect me to do so sooner rather than later.",1

9780156033688,2024/06/26,historical-fiction read slay,read,1,5,"Ursula K. Le Guin's Greco-Roman mythical retelling from 2008, way before these kinds of novels became ""cool"" and everyone started writing them.<br/><br/>Lavinia tells the story of, well, Lavinia, a character in Vergil's Aeneid who isn't given any speaking lines. Lavinia being such a paper thin character gives Le Guin the opportunity to fill in the many gaps. And, to no one's surprise, she's done a great job of it.<br/><br/><b>Minor story spoilers to follow</b><br/><br/>Le Guin's Lavinia is not a story told straight. At the start of the novel, Vergil, the poet, appears before Lavinia as a spirit and speaks with her at length. Lavinia quickly becomes aware of her future as told by Vergil.<br/><br/>Lavinia also becomes aware of her own existence as a fictional character but also recognizes that Vergil didn't write much about her, leaving her with some semblance of free will. The same can't be said for her husband Aeneas because he's the main character in Vergil's poem.<br/><br/>It's meta, it's weird.<br/><br/>But I like it.<br/><br/>Prior to reading Lavinia, I was familiar with Homer's Odyssey and Iliad but I wasn't familiar with Vergil's Aeneid. Lavinia as a text works better the more you know about Greco-Roman mythology but Le Guin's premise combined with her choice of narrator makes this knowledge less of a requirement and more of a nice to have.<br/><br/>Le Guin's narrator often foreshadows events to come such that whether you're familiar with the Aeneid or not you'll still know what's going to happen.<br/><br/>It works because Lavinia is Le Guin's master class on foreshadowing. Her partially revealing a part of the story to come, often left me much more invested in the novel than I would have been otherwise. Sure, I was told that something was going to happen but the how and why was left open to speculation. Often, I felt as though the revelation of a story beat to come left me with more questions than answers.<br/><br/>It's clear from reading the text but also from Le Guin's afterword that Lavinia was inspired from her reading of Vergil's Aeneid as a Greek tragedy. Le Guin's use of foreshadowing in Lavinia often leads to moments of heightened tension and tragic irony due to the difference between what most of the characters know (Lavinia excluded usually) and what the reader knows. I liked this!<br/><br/>Le Guin wrote Lavinia relatively late in her career and it shows. I feel as though in Lavinia, Le Guin is using all of the skills she's acquired through her long and prolific career and she's nailing it.<br/><br/>You should read it, especially if you're a fan of Le Guin or if you're into Greco-Roman myth/literature!<br/><br/>I've taken note of a bunch of quotes from the book, I'm keeping them here with some of my thoughts for posterity.<br/><br/><blockquote> How is it that you understand me, who lived twenty- five or thirty centuries ago? Do you know Latin?<br/><br/>But then I think no, it has nothing to do with being dead, it's not death that allows us to understand one another, but poetry. </blockquote><br/><br/>Le Guin big upping the use of poetry, and presumably literature as a whole, as an effective means of travelling through time to try and understand the people who came before us.<br/><br/><blockquote> I sat in silence. I wanted to cry, but had no tears. ""I will be gone soon,"" the poet said. ""I will join the crowd, return to darkness.""<br/><br/>""Not yet—""<br/><br/>""Keep me here. Keep me here, Lavinia. Tell me it is better to be alive, better to be a slave living than Achilles dead. Tell me I can finish my work!""<br/><br/>""If you never finish it, it will never end,"" [...] </blockquote><br/><br/>Famously, Vergil never finished writing the Aenied. Potentially leaving more space for artists who came after him, including Le Guin, to take the text, remix it and finish it in a way appropriate for their own time and place.<br/><br/><blockquote> I had hated him while he told that tale of slaughter, but I was losing him, now, already, moment by moment, and I loved him, yearning to him. ""Wait—Only tell me—your poem, my poem, did you finish it?""<br/><br/>He seemed to nod, but I could hardly see him, a tall shadow in shadows.<br/><br/>""Don't go yet—""<br/><br/>""I must go, my glory. I am gone. I join the crowd, return to darkness.""<br/><br/>I cried out his name, went forward, reaching out my arms to hold him, to keep him from death, but it was like holding a breath of the night wind. Nothing was there. </blockquote><br/><br/>The fact that Vergil plays such a big role in Le Guin's retelling of the Aenid constantly amazes me.<br/><br/><blockquote> It has not been difficult for me to believe in my fictionality, because it is, after all, so slight. But for him it would be very difficult. Even if he is at the moment inactive, domesticated, a contented man sitting in the sunlight talking with his wife, the poet's passionate, commanding, anxious, dangerous hero would find it hard to accept contingence, the nullity of his will and conscience. Piety, faithfulness, obedience to what must be rightly done, the fas, is the desire of his heart. To know that he has obeyed a poet, rather than his conscience, might be anguish to him —even if he saw, as I see, that the poet obeyed his conscience and followed the fas. Why should I trouble him with that, when his concerns are so great and his time so short? </blockquote><br/><br/>Lavinia is reflecting on her own existence as a fictional character in someone else's story. Yet, because Vergil did not have much to say about Lavinia, she's more able to believe that she's fictional.<br/><br/>Unlike her husband Aeneas. Of course, this conceit is Le Guin explaining away why Lavinia chooses to stay quiet about Aeneas' future. A novel in which Lavinia does might be interesting but I trust that Le Guin knows what does and doesn't work in a novel.<br/><br/>Either way, very meta stuff.<br/><br/><blockquote> It was a big crowd, and more coming in across the fields all the time. The men all carried weapons, whether they were farm tools or hunter's bows or swords and bronze-tipped lances. As they grouped together they made a dark, endless noise. I looked down from the roof at the top of the laurel in the courtyard where the bees had swarmed. But these men were not the foreigners the bees had foretold. They were Latins, Laurentians, Italians. My people. My enemies. </blockquote><br/><br/>This paragraph is a testament to Le Guin's ability to imbue her work with so much meaning yet she does so, so succinctly.<br/><br/><b>My people. My enemies.</b><br/><br/>Huhhhhh it's so good.<br/><br/><blockquote> I looked for the woman warrior my poet had said would ride with the Volscians, but I did not see her. But then, he said he had invented her. But had he not invented all of us? I tried to take comfort in that, to pretend that it was all a pretense, all the shouted orders and clashed weapons and sharpened swords, the nervous horses and swaggering men. The horrible list of carnage my poet had told me on the last night, that was what they were making ready for. But why, what was it for? For a pet deer? For a girl? What good would that be?<br/><br/>Without war there are no heroes. </blockquote><br/>1. Fiction is as real as any story we tell ourselves about the past or our memories of it. The stories we tell ourselves are a reflection of who we are, and the stories we tell each other change who we are. Whether they're fictional or not.<br/>2. <b>Without war there are no heroes.</b> Le Guin seems to be pointing out an assumption made by the poetic/literary tradition she's been inspired by. To be heroic in a Homeric poem is to be a veteran of war and it seems like that sort of idea has withstood the test of time for better or worse. Something something toxic masculinity.<br/><br/><blockquote> My mind went round and round on these thoughts and my heart was torn and miserable, wanting to rejoice with the people around me but unable to. I felt myself a traitor, as if I had done the great wrong, had caused it simply by being who and what I was. My mother had taught me that self-pitying guilt, and I had known it most of my life. Though I fought against it, knowing it childish and mistaken, under this stress and pressure it was all too easy to be childish, to be mistaken, to drop back into it. </blockquote><br/><br/>Absolutely fucking brutal. Le Guin, you're tearing me apart.<br/><br/><blockquote> ""What am I to do?""<br/><br/>I did feel shame, hearing that.<br/><br/>""Act like a man, for once, if you can't act like a king. If you want to know how a king acts, look at Turnus.""<br/><br/>There was a silence, then a sound of movement, a shift or scuffle, in the dark room, a sharp ""Ah!"" from my mother.<br/><br/>""Enough,"" my father said, even lower, but with a different tone. ""Enough of Turnus. He is not my son, or yours. He is not Lavinia's husband. Or yours. Go back to your rooms now. Keep silent. Do not send any more messengers to Turnus. My men have intercepted them. Even if the Trojans are defeated, that will not make Turnus king of Latium. I will never make him king of Latium. Nor will you! Now go."" </blockquote><br/><br/>Lavinia's mother is absolutely awful, especially to Lavinia. But this scene of spousal violence was tough to read.<br/><br/>Sure, Lavinia's mom is a gigantic cunt. But she also lost two of her children when they were young and that loss has affected her in understandable ways.<br/><br/>I don't think she's portrayed as a particularly sympathetic character, and yet I felt bad for her time and time again.<br/><br/><blockquote> I remember Aeneas' words as I remember the poet's words. I remember every word because they are the fabric of my life, the warp I am woven on. All my life since Aeneas' death might seem a weaving torn out of the loom unfinished, a shapeless tangle of threads making nothing, but it is not so; for my mind returns as the shuttle returns always to the starting place, finding the pattern, going on with it. I was a spinner, not a weaver, but I have learned to weave. </blockquote><br/><br/>The Fates!<br/><br/><blockquote> The women around us bowed their heads or knelt down, and the people crowded into the streets and up on the walls and roofs fell silent listening.<br/><br/>I felt flow into me from them a loving trustfulness, a flood of feeling that humbled my mind and yet gave me a sense of great and reliable support. I was their daughter, their pledge to the future, a powerless girl yet one who could speak for them to the great powers, a mere token for political barter yet also a sign of what was of true value to us all. I stood among my people in silence when the ritual was done, all of us quiet as the birds that stand in hundreds at evening on the sea beach, seeming to worship together.<br/><br/>And so we could hear the noise outside the walls—rumble and clash and crash, neighing and yelling and thunder of hooves and feet, the noise of an army making ready for war. </blockquote><br/><br/>So good.<br/><br/><blockquote> ""Indeed. Women can gain wisdom,"" Ascanius announced, with his irritating, touching pomposity. ""But not true virtue.""<br/><br/>""But what is piety?"" Aeneas asked.<br/><br/>That brought a thoughtful silence.<br/><br/>""Obedience to the will of the powers of earth and sky?"" I said at last, making my statement a question, as women so often do.<br/><br/>""The effort to fulfill one's destiny,"" Achates said.<br/><br/>""Doing right,"" said Illivia, Serestus' wife, a calm, forceful woman from Tusculum, who had become one of my dearest friends.<br/><br/>""What is right in battle, in war?"" Aeneas asked.<br/><br/>""Skill, courage, strength,"" Ascanius answered promptly. ""In war, virtue is piety. Fighting to win!""<br/><br/>""So victory makes right?""<br/><br/>""Yes,"" Ascanius said, and several of the men nodded vigorously; but the older Trojans, some of them, did not. Nor did the women.<br/><br/>""I cannot make it out,"" Aeneas said in his quiet voice. ""I thought what a man knew he ought to do was what he must do. But what if they're not the same? Then, to win a victory is to be defeated. To uphold order is to cause disorder, ruin, death. Virtue and piety destroy each other. I cannot make it out.""<br/><br/>Even Ascanius had no answer for that. </blockquote><br/><br/><b>""Obedience to the will of the powers of earth and sky?"" I said at last, making my statement a question, as women so often do.</b> It sucks that this is the way things are now.<br/><br/><blockquote> ""It's a good place for a child, the woods. You don't learn much about people, but you learn silence. Patience. And that there's nothing much to fear in the wilderness—less than there is on a farm or in the city."" </blockquote><br/><br/>One of Le Guin's many moments in her work where she fantasizes about a ""return to nature"". Also, present in her Earthsea series (Ogion, Ged the farmer).<br/><br/><blockquote> Three years, the poet had said. Three years to the day it was. The three old women who spin and cut the thread had measured exactly, to the inch, nothing to spare. No gift of summer days. </blockquote><br/><br/>The Fates! Again.<br/><br/><blockquote> I have not told this all in order as it happened. It is still hard to speak of. A month after Aeneas' death I lost the fetus that might have been my daughter. Only my women knew that I had been pregnant and that the pregnancy miscarried. Only my women and Aeneas knew. I went with Maruna in the dark before dawn and we buried the tiny scrap of life that had not lived, deep under the great stones of Aeneas' grave. </blockquote><br/><br/>Like her mother, Lavinia loses a child she was hoping to see grow up. There's shared trauma there. As Lavinia lives her life, she gradually comes to understand her mother's behavior and trauma better over time.<br/><br/><blockquote> I did indeed understand something of how my mother's mind worked in her frenzy: the ceaseless whirl of ideas, plans, schemes, the terrible irritation with anything that turned thought from its obsession and with anyone who did not understand it, and the curious sense of waiting in ambush. I remembered two pale gold eyes that shone of their own light. I was the she-wolf in the cave, standing stiff-legged, silent, in darkness, ready. </blockquote><br/><br/>There you go.<br/><br/><blockquote> But as I said it I knew that it was not true. Aeneas had not been there with me as a man in the flesh, nor had Anchises spoken. It was the poet who spoke. It was all the words of the poet, the words of the maker, the foreteller, the truth teller: nothing more, nothing less. But was I myself any more, or less, than that?<br/><br/>And this was nothing I could say to any living soul, or ever did, till now. </blockquote><br/><br/>Lavinia grappling again with her fictionality and what it means for her.<br/><br/>Meta meta meta.<br/><br/><blockquote> But after a time I began to like my solitude. I lost the wish for any visitor or voice to break the silence of the trees, threaded always with the singing of insects and birds and the sound of wind in leaves. I gardened, and spun, and wove on the big loom set up in the second room, and was content with silence, until my son came back at evening to eat with me and talk a little, quietly, before sleep. </blockquote><br/><br/>""RETURN TO NATURE. RETURN TO NATURE. RETURN TO NATURE.""<br/><br/>_Le Guin slowly rocked back and forth, hugging her knees to her chest as she repeated those faithful words._<br/><br/><blockquote> I was fated, it seems, to live among people who suffered beyond measure from grief, who were driven mad by it. Though I suffered grief, I was doomed to sanity. This was no doing of the poet's. I know that he gave me nothing but modest blushes, and no character at all. I know that he said I raved and tore my golden tresses at my mother's death. He simply was not paying attention: I was silent then, tearless, and only intent on making her poor soiled body decent. And my hair has always been dark. In truth he gave me nothing but a name, and I have filled it with myself. Yet without him would I even have a name? I have never blamed him. Even a poet cannot get everything right.<br/><br/>It is strange, though, that he gave me no voice. I never spoke to him till we met that night by the altar under the oaks. Where is my voice from, I wonder? the voice that cries on the wind in the heights of Albunea, the voice that speaks with no tongue a language not its own? </blockquote><br/><br/>The Fates! Again again.<br/><br/><blockquote> I fly among the trees on soft wings that make no sound. Sometimes I call out, but not in a human voice. My cry is soft and quavering: i, i, I cry: Go on, go.<br/><br/>Only sometimes my soul wakes as a woman again, and then when I listen I can hear silence, and in the silence his voice. </blockquote><br/><br/>Le Guin's Lavinia ends with a bang.",1

9780316388696,2023/09/25,fantasy read trash,read,1,1,"""The Raven Tower"" is one of the worst books I have ever read. I've only covered the tip of the iceberg in this review because reading through this book has left me completely drained of energy. Please don't read this book, it is beyond trash. If you really want to, I can't stop you but I really wish I could.<br/><br/>I have an important question for y'all.<br/><br/>Is this how people speak?<br/><br/><blockquote>""He must have had help, yes. Stalker surely helped him, it was worth her while to do it. Do you think it would be less worth the Raven's, to offer such opportunity to my father? Even with the god so distant, between Instruments, it's a small thing to provide a sharp edge, a weapon in reach, anything. And do you imagine that, offered that help, my father would have failed to take it? He was loyal to the Raven. He was the Lease, and he knew his duty.""</blockquote><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>On one hand, this is great art because reading through dialogue like this makes me question my own existence. Is it really possible that a human being wrote this paragraph of dialogue and was like: ""Job's done... My God, I'm good!""?<br/><br/>On the other hand, reading dialogue like this is immersion breaking and I don't like it.<br/><br/>It gets worse.<br/><br/>What is the purpose of having characters speaking in awfully written broken English?<br/><br/><blockquote>""A funeral. The old Lease is not have a funeral. There is a new Lease—I know it is so. I am in Vastai for days and days and the Lease is not see us. Now the Lease is see us—once—and this man who is the Lease is not the Lease before.""</blockquote><br/><br/>I'm not an expert linguist so maybe it's possible for someone to learn language X then try to learn language Y and the result of that is this. Maybe?<br/><br/>But why?<br/><br/>I just read through Shards of Earth by Adrian Tchaikovsky which is a book featuring many alien beings who speak in a variety of weird ways all serving to give them a unique identity and immerse you into the world.<br/><br/>Like yes, the crab people speaking through a translator device of questionable quality would be different and the author can use that difference as a tool to craft a more compelling narrative.<br/><br/>And comparing that to this is jarring. Nobody is benefiting from the dialogue being written this way, just let these characters speak normally or make them speak in an interesting way that reflects a difference in their beliefs, unique to them. Something, anything! Not like this.<br/><br/>Let's move on.<br/><br/>Not only is the way the dialogue is written bad but what characters choose to say to each other is also awful.<br/><br/>There are many conversations in this book where each character seems to know everything that every other character knows. It sounds like each of them is reading from a terrible script handed down to them by a single person.<br/><br/>Obviously, all books are written this way. But an author's job is to convince the reader that these characters actually exist, each having their own goals, behaviors, etc. and aren't just mindless puppets controlled entirely by the author.<br/><br/>You could argue that this awful writing is explained by the premise of the book. The fact that the story is narrated by a god in a universe where a god's words have power and in saying something it becomes true.<br/><br/>However, even if that's the case, I dislike when books have premises that explain away the author's inability to write well (refer to I'm Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reid for another example of this)<br/><br/>Is everything in this book terrible? No. But it's hard for me to focus on the OK parts of the book because the bad parts are so bad.<br/><br/>The story is split into two POVs. One of a god and one of a person. The characterization of Eolo, the person, is really bad and his chapters are weak (and filled with awful dialogue). The god's POV is better because it has much less dialogue and it's weird in a way that has potential.<br/><br/>It feels like Ann Leckie wrote a decent story from a unique perspective (the god) and was told that it wouldn't sell because it would be hard for readers to relate to a god who is literally just a big rock.<br/><br/>So, she had to go back in and interlace another story with human characters that people could relate to more easily.<br/><br/>And so, we get a novel that's very uneven with half the chapters being equal parts boring and unbelievable and the other half being not fully realized.<br/><br/>I'm going to add Ann Leckie to my growing list of hack authors who had a single good idea in them.<br/><br/>But that one good idea that made them successful was a fluke. Despite continuously going back to that well, they don't understand what actually made their first successful work resonate with people and so are unable to recreate the success they achieved in the past.<br/><br/>It's sad to see these authors who at one time were put on a pedestal and told: ""Hey, you're special, keep it up!"". Only for everyone to eventually realize that it was all lies. Actually they weren't special, they were lucky.<br/><br/>Everyone's luck runs out at some point, it's not a matter of if but a matter of when. And some authors are luckier than others.<br/><br/>Life's short, I can't afford to waste my time reading a book like this again. Ann Leckie you've been banned, my eyes shall never grace a page of text you've written ever again. I wish you all the best.<br/><br/>Unlucky authors list: Neil Gaiman, Ann Leckie, Jeff VanderMeer",1

Gradually, she figures out how to leverage the attic's power to her advantage, using it to help her find her ideal husband and her ideal self.<br/><br/>Importantly, each husband comes bundled with a multiverse version of reality in which Lauren met and married said husband. Whenever a new husband comes out of the attic Lauren finds herself in a changed world where her job, her relationships and her body are different than the ones she had before.<br/><br/>This attic provides Lauren with the means to play out various ""what ifs"" with these husbands and the other lives attached to each of them.<br/><br/>Eventually, she gets tired of this meaningless rat race-like game she's been playing for far too long, swiping her way through hundreds of husbands.<br/><br/>The meaninglessness Lauren feels is caused by her being the only person in her life who remembers with any kind of permanence what she's been through (and with whom) and with each reset even her capacity to retain the memories of her past lives degrades.<br/><br/>Lauren comes to the realization that her self is constructed and given meaning in large part by the relationships she fosters in her life and by resetting these with every attic-ing she's killing a part of herself and not really living the way she should.<br/><br/>So, Lauren chooses to end this farce and live a real life by burning the attic to the ground --- forcing herself to live out the rest of her days with the last husband the attic produces for her in whatever reasonable version of reality he comes with.<br/><br/>In other words, she puts the controller away and chooses to live her life instead of continuously escaping into others.<br/><br/>The themes of this novel are simple, innoffensive and effectively delivered: escapism is bad, live in the moment, seize the day, etc. We've all heard these imperative statements about how to live a good life a million times, they're understandable but are hard to always live by in practice.<br/><br/>But not every novel has to be the philosophical masterpiece of the century, in the Husbands, Gramazio has gotten her comedy down to a science and that's just as impressive to me, perhaps even more so because of how hard writing a funny book seems to be.<br/><br/>I cannot stress how funny the Husbands is... Watching Gramazio use Lauren as a very likeable mouthpiece to unleash peak British-y, sarcastic and dry humor page after page while having the majority of the jokes land is an experience unlike any other I've had reading a novel in recent memory. <br/><br/>But, the Husbands isn't perfect but its strengths more than make up for it failings.<br/><br/>One of which is the ending which feels a little rushed. It's way too tidy and predictable for my tastes. In the afterword, Gramazio reveals that her first draft had three endings. I interpret this to mean that The Husbands was some sort of limited Choose Your Own Adventure novel initially which might explain why the leadup to the ending felt a little undercooked.<br/><br/>The Husbands feels like a much more lighthearted riff on time loop stories like <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780356502588/"">the First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North</a>.

If you liked any of these books, you'll probably get a kick out of the other two!<br/></spoiler><br/>What can I tell you? British writers fall into two categories: the funny ones and the bigoted sex pests with heinous polital beliefs. Holly Gramazio is really funny and thank God for that.

How would they know if we didn't tell them?""</blockquote><br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780441172719/"">Dune***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780593098233/"">Dune Messiah***</a> ★★★★<br/><br/>Having watched both David Lynch's Dune and Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part One, I feel like although both are interesting and good in their own way (yes, even the David Lynch movie), Dune is a story best told as a novel, by adapting Dune into a movie you lose a lot of what makes Dune interesting.<br/><br/>Maybe if Jodorowsky had been able to achieve his vision of a 15 hour long movie adaptation of Dune, I'd feel differently... but here we are.<br/><br/>What makes Frank Herbert's Dune novel so special for me? Well, it's a few things. The concerns present in the text (environmental, technological, late capitalism-related, ideological) have only become more relevant in the decades since the novel was written.<br/><br/>The novel is by no means perfect and one could argue that Denis Villeneuve's movie is a better and more cohesive ""product"" compared to the novel. But Denis Villeneuve's movie suffers from being a big budget movie that has to condense and drop many of the more interesting parts of the novel and whitewash or completely remove the novel's more subversive ideas.<br/><br/>Another part of the novel that I enjoy quite a bit which isn't present in the movies is Frank Herbert's mastery of the shifting POV. Multiple POV characters is not anything new to me, almost every single novel I read has multiple POV characters. Dune is different because it has an omniscient narrator that dives deep into the psyche of each of the characters it's focusing on, showing the reader their inner thoughts and concerns while also smoothly flowing from one character to the next within the same chapter, even the same paragraph.<br/><br/><blockquote>One thought remained to him. [POV Character 1] saw it in formless light on rays of black: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain.<br/><br/>Silence.<br/><br/>[POV Character 2] stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole behind the table. He had slammed it on a room full of dead men. His senses took in guards swarming around him. Did I breathe it? he asked himself.</blockquote><br/><br/>I'm not too surprised why this is rarely done today. It must be hard to do well and even when done well it's much harder for the reader to follow. It seems as though a lot of readers today, perhaps this has always been true, skim through the texts they read. You can't skim through a text like Dune and expect to understand what's going on at all times because of the constantly switching focus of the omniscient narrator.<br/><br/>Are there any problems with Frank Herbert's Dune? Absolutely. The one issue that stands out to me is the introduction of Feyd-Rautha in the last quarter of the book. Unlike every other character in the novel who is introduced early on and built upon throughout the text, Feyd-Rautha shows up out of nowhere and we're expected to care about his bullshit.<br/><br/>I wonder if this discrepancy comes from Dune's initial publication as a two-part serial? I don't know but it doesn't work for me. Feyd-Rautha should have been introduced way earlier which would have given the reader more time to build the character up in their minds before the final confrontation with him at the end of the novel.<br/><br/>I'm in love with Dune and I'm committed to reading through its sequel Dune Messiah next. If I enjoy that, I'll likely be taking a look at Children of Dune sooner than later.<br/><br/>PS: Special mention to Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son. Reading through Brian's afterword to Dune and his foreword to the sequel Dune Messiah brought me a lot of joy because of how childish, clownish and delusional Brian Herbert seems to be.<br/><br/><blockquote>As if whispering in his own ear, Frank Herbert constantly reminded himself that he was mortal. If he had been a politician, he would have undoubtedly been an honorable one, perhaps even one of our greatest U.S. presidents.</blockquote><br/><br/>Also, Brian Herbert is clearly someone who does not understand what made his father's work resonate so widely and the fact that the ""Dune"" torch was passed down to him is truly sad.

The remnants of humanity, after a nuclear apocalypse occurs, are ""saved"" by aliens and forced to choose between mating with their saviors or never being able to have children again. The rest of the novels didn't hit me as hard but they were interesting nonetheless.<br/><br/>Dawn - 5 stars Adulthood Rites - 3 stars Imago - 3 stars<br/><br/>What follows is mostly me rambling about the series.<br/><br/>This series is about biological determinism, consent, imbalanced power dynamics and sexual violence (among other things). Although, the books don't wrestle with these topics as much as I think they should have.<br/><br/>The first book contains a scene of sexual violence that is really phucked up despite not being very explicit. Overall, this book goes HARD. The imagery is powerful and will stick with me for a long time to come.<br/><br/>Adulthood Rites, the second book in the series, follows, from the POV of a mixed-species boy, the story of humanity repopulating the Earth and the tensions between the settlements of human-alien hybrids and the Human resisters who've chosen to be sterilized but free(ish) from alien influence.<br/><br/>It's not as memorable as the first book. It lacks the novelty and the raw-ness of the first book.<br/><br/>The third book in the series, Imago, follows the story of a one of a kind mixed-species ooloi (neither man or woman, a third sex) as it discovers who it is and what it can do (a lot — it can manipulate the genes of others and itself at will). Despite having an intriguing premise, it's the weakest of the three books. It's ending feels rushed and the lead up to it was disappointing.<br/><br/>It feels as though the series would have been better served by spending more time reckoning with the fact that as the protagonists become less and less human in each book, what comes naturally to them (AKA using pheromones and the best sex skills this side of the universe to have sex with people who ARE NOT biologically capable of providing actual consent) is extremely phucked up and turns them into monsters (at least from the perspective of the reader).<br/><br/>Lilith's Brood is so far removed from the reality that we live in that I found it hard to extrapolate much of anything meaningful from the text other than the absolute rollercoaster ride of emotions that I got from reading the first book.<br/><br/>The text is outlandish but it also seems somewhat uninterested in tackling the ethical issues it takes on through its premise. And so, I felt a little disappointed by the end. I was expecting for a bit more push and pull and more of a focus on the ethics of it all.<br/><br/>Although, I felt that, other than a few minor issues, the world felt internally consistent for the most part. And it was easy for me to immerse myself in the universe that Butler built. Despite feeling somewhat cold on the series as a whole, I'm pretty invested in Butler's writing and I'm interested in reading more from her.<br/><br/>She's blown me away with how bold her writing can be. Nobody else would fill a book with this much rape and get away with it.",1

Grunts is a satire of the schlocky high fantasy Tolkien ripoffs of the 70s and 80s. It pokes fun at the aesthetic of the American military as portrayed in film and literature. It combines Grand Guignol (think slapstick but extra gory and violent) dark comedy with satire on bad fantasy.<br/><br/>The story begins with a group of orcs, the Agaku led by the orc Ashnak, tasked with stealing powerful yet non-magical weapons from a dragon's hoard by the nameless necromancer. The pretense for this quest is that these weapons will be useful for the Final Battle between the forces of Light and Dark that's about to happen.<br/><br/>These weapons turn out to be an impressive assortment of modern military equipment: assault rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, tanks, helicopters, surface to air missile launchers...<br/><br/>You name it, they've got it.<br/><br/>The Agaku are your stereotypical generic fantasy orcs: a little stupid, violent, strong. The dragon's hoard of modern military weaponry was cursed with a geas which changes the mindset of the orcs into the stereotypical Vietnam War United States Marine Corps soldier mindset: huuuuuurrah-ing, tabbaco chewing, cigar smoking, a belief that might makes right, etc.<br/><br/>Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/><b>Minor Spoilers Ahead</b><br/><br/>It turns out that the modern military equipment the orc marines have access to isn't enough to turn the tide of the Final Battle. The forces of Light win but many of the forces of Dark, including Ashnak and his orc marines, manage to escape. The orc marines return to their fort in Nin-Edin.<br/><br/>In the following weeks, the forces of Light chase down and ethnically cleanse (we'll get into it) the remaining forces of Dark. This leads to a siege (take a shot every time Mary Gentle depicts a siege in her work) where Ashnak and his orc marines have dug into their fort at Nin-Edin and are preparing to fend off the forces of Light.<br/><br/>Note that all this happens in the first third of the novel, subverting the trope of the not so final Final Battle.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Let's talk about the forces of Light. Epic fantasy has always had a problematic relationship with presenting good/bad in black and white terms with little room in between. My understanding is that this simplicity appeals to the human desire to constantly simplify the eternally complex real world in order to live within it.<br/><br/>That's fine. But by presenting good/bad like this, it's easy to fall into the trap (intentionally or not) of depicting certain beings as inherently evil. <br/><br/>Dehumanizing the human.<br/><br/>Mary Gentle portrays the forces of Light and Dark....<br/><br/>posits that the weapons we have access to change us (power corrupts), she posits that power is power and war is war,<br/><br/>... fantasy satire with grit.

Yalom describes Yalom's psychotherapeutic framework based around acknowledging and dealing with the anxiety caused by the following existential issues: death anxiety, freedom (or lack of it), loneliness (towards others and towards one's self) and the meaninglessness of existence.<br/><br/>All major religions provide their believers with explanations for all these questions and concerns. For example, with respect to death anxiety, most Christians believe in Heaven, so if a Christian lives a good life then when they die they'll wake up in Heaven and they'll remain there for the rest of eternity. These beliefs help those who believe swallow the bitter pill that is the human experience.<br/><br/>Sadly, the rest of us are cursed with the knowledge that when we die, our body will cease to function and we will cease to exist and, given enough time, we and everything we've ever done will be forgotten. We, unfortunately, understand that the universe was not built for a purpose, it exists for no particular reason and, perhaps, all our lives we've been pawns, being moved around in a game of Chess played by no one in particular.<br/><br/>Understandably, this can be anxiety inducing. In Existential Psychotherapy, Yalom broadly discusses many approaches people have taken to cope with these existential issues and shares them with the reader.<br/><br/>You can easily overcome your anxiety of death by having a near-death experience or being diagnosed with a terminal illness. Knowing that you're going to die in the near future or that you came very close to, will probably help you make the most of the time you have left.<br/><br/>You can foster deeper connections with others through volunteering and thus create meaning in your life where there was none to begin with.<br/><br/>Or, you can become a fascist (See Will Durant's On the Meaning of Life) or join some other kind of community of like-minded people, to give yourself a purpose and have a support group for when times get tough.<br/><br/>Also, you can choose (or can you?) to believe that free will exists (even though it probably doesn't) because believing that free will exists will probably make you happier (delulu is the solulu).<br/><br/>So... Ya. There's no solving the problem posed by existentialism. One must simply try and find ways of living that help you get through it and hopefully, if you're lucky, thrive.<br/><br/>Despite not being written for the layman, Yalom's Existential Psychotherapy was a compelling read if only for the clear explanations on what existentialism is and what people have tried to do to deal with the consequences of it. I'm less enthusiastic about the extremely detailed case studies and the many weird non-scientific claims Yalom makes.<br/><br/>Reading this book will not instantly put you at ease and act as a warm blanket in the cold meaningless world we find ourselves in but Yalom doesn't claim that it will.

We tell them it could be pretty good right here if only they'd put their minds to it.""</blockquote><br/><br/>I was interested to see a few possible references to Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series in Mort.

Essentially everything in the Earthsea world has a ""true name"". If you know the ""true name"" of something or something one, this grants you power over the thing with this ""true name"".<br/><br/>Mort is published in 1987, and the first three books of Le Guin's Earthsea are all published prior to 1972 with the first novel in the series, the Wizard of Earthsea, being published as early as 1968. So timeline-wise, it would make sense that Pratchett might be making an explicit reference to Le Guin's Earthsea series here.<br/><br/>This could be just a coincidence. The reason that I don't think it is one, is because earlier in Mort, Pratchett makes another claim about wizards that lines up with how wizards in the Earthsea series are depicted.<br/><br/>[INSERT THE ACTUAL QUOTE FOR THIS WHEN I DO A SECOND READ OF THIS NOVEL...]<br/><br/>At some point, Pratchett comments on the fact that wizards are celibate in Discworld, or something to that effect.<br/><br/>If you've read Le Guin's Earthsea series, you'll know about the way she depicts certain wizards as being voluntarily celibate because they believe that having intimate relations with women will drain their magical powers.<br/><br/>Neither Le Guin's Earthsea series nor Terry Pratchett's Discworld (although I'm not complete on that one), touches on gay wizards, if you're interested in that, please check out <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780756411381"">Mercedes Lackey's The Last Herald-Mage Trilogy</a>.<br/><br/>PS: Remember kids, magic is stored in the balls.",1

""Are you going to come quietly?"" The mumbling went on. The air began to feel hot and dry. Vimes shrugged. ""That's it, then,"" he said, and turned away. ""Throw the book at him, Carrot."" ""Right, sir."" Vimes remembered too late.<br/><br/>Dwarfs have trouble with metaphors. They also have a very good aim. The Laws and Ordinances of Ankh and Morpork caught the [...] on the forehead. He blinked, staggered, and stepped backwards. It was the longest step he ever took. For one thing, it lasted the rest of his life.</blockquote><br/><br/>Nobby is the everyman, he is very down to earth.<br/><br/><blockquote>It always amazed Vimes how Nobby got along with practically everyone. It must, he'd decided, have something to do with the common denominator. In the entire world of mathematics there could be no denominator as common as Nobby.</blockquote><br/><br/>Sergeant Colon is the boomer of the group.<br/><br/><blockquote>Sergeant Colon owed thirty years of happy marriage to the fact that Mrs Colon worked all day and Sergeant Colon worked all night. They communicated by means of notes. He got her tea ready before he left at night, she left his breakfast nice and hot in the oven in the mornings. They had three grown-up children, all born, Vimes had assumed, as a result of extremely persuasive handwriting.</blockquote><br/><br/>These are the men who've been tasked with keeping the city safe. Conveniently, Ankh-Morpork quickly finds itself under attack by a powerful force and Captain Vimes and his constables (with a LOT of help from the larger than life noblewoman Lady Sybil Ramkin and her stable of swamp dragons) are the only people standing in the way of the total destruction of the city.<br/><br/>Guards! Guards! is not my favorite of Terry Pratchett's work. It's one of his earlier novels in the Discworld universe so he's still figuring things out.<br/><br/>The parts where the POV shifts away from the Night Watch (and Sybil) are not as compelling and could have probably been edited away.<br/><br/>But, everything else is great. The jokes land. The characters are paper thin and yet somehow Terry manages to make them come to life anyway. Their chemistry is off the charts and it's a joy to read.<br/><br/>Of course, Carrot being a dwarf in a human body can be read as him being autistic (one of many examples of autistic representation in Terry Pratchett's work).<br/><br/>He takes things very literally. He's oblivious to social cues. It's pretty on the nose.<br/><br/>I appreciate this depiction because despite him being a caricature, every other character is too. He's never the butt of the joke, his actions might be what cause a comical situation to occur but we're not laughing at him. We're laughing at the situation that Carrot and the other constables find themselves in.<br/><br/>Carrot, unlike the rest of Night Watch, seems to be genuinely happy about being a constable (proven by the letters he regularly writes to his parents back home). He has a positive outlook on life and is happy to be where he is. Over time, his positive outlook rubs off on the other constables, gets them to get off their asses and get to work helping people.<br/><br/>Carrot is oblivious to the fact that when he first comes to Ankh-Morpork, he's essentially working as a bouncer for a whorehouse (he believes that the Lady of the house just has a bunch of unmarried daughters).<br/><br/>Sure, he's different but that's OK. This is one example of many in Terry Pratchett's work of characters who are really out there and different and people around them love them anyway.<br/><br/>The implication, whether that was Terry's intent or not, is that you can be different in your own way and you can be loved too.<br/><br/>The real world isn't as simple as a Terry Pratchett novel. But his work is a constant reminder that there's at least one person on the planet who understood a part of my struggle and accepts me (and people like me) for who I am.<br/><br/>If there's one person like Terry out there, there's got to be more. Even though Terry passed away in 2015, the positive influence of his work continues to spread and I suspect (and I hope) that many people will continue to enjoy his work for many generations to come.<br/><br/>His work deserves it.",1

The main plot as well as every sub plot has something to say about prejudice, how it can cloud our judgement and prevent us from doing the right thing and treating everyone with the respect they deserve.<br/><br/>The choice to have the protagonist be a prototypical white man in a position of power is great because I would have had a hard time taking the novel seriously if Terry Pratchett, a very white man, had chosen to tell this story from the perspective of a minority.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes is an honest man doing the best he can but sometimes that's just not good enough. So, for me, throughout the novel, he flip-flopped between being the hero I was rooting for and the antihero I loved to hate.<br/><br/><b>Minor story spoilers</b><br/><spoiler><br/>An example of this is when Sam Vimes suffers a particularly heinous attack from a few deep dwarves. He feels extremely angry and frustrated about this (rightfully so) but unfortunately he expresses that anger by mistreating other dwarves who had nothing to do with the attack.<br/><br/>This hits home for me because it's something we see time and time again in our own world.<br/><br/>For example, post-911, Muslims around the world suffered from an increase in hate crimes against them. This is a tragedy because the actions of a few extremists (completely divorced from Islam) led to all this hate being directed towards the wrong people. Another more recent example of this was post-COVID, there was a similar increase in hate crimes towards Asian people who, obviously, had nothing to do with COVID, other than suffering because of it like everyone else.<br/><br/>So when Vimes starts getting pissed at dwarves in the same way, it felt real.<br/></spoiler><br/>Thud! is filled with situations like this; touching on issues like discrimination in the workplace, police brutality, racism, etc. that lend a weight to the story that isn't usually present in other Discworld novels. I'm really into it!<br/><br/>Thud! was published right after Going Postal (which is my favorite Discworld novel I've read so far) and they seem to share quite a bit of DNA. With Going Postal dealing with capitalism, toxic corporate culture, bureaucracy (and more!) instead of the topics covered in Thud!.<br/><br/>If you like Going Postal, you might like Thud! (and vice-versa). I love both tremendously.<br/><br/>As of right now, Thud! has taken my second favorite Terry Pratchett novel slot; bumping Thief of Time down to a respectable third place.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with Terry Pratchett.

When I saw the thickness of the book, the number of lines on each page and the miniscule size of the font, I was scared that I wouldn't be able to read through the whole thing.<br/><br/>All it took for me to get over that fear was reading the first few pages. Mary Gentle hooked me with her commitment to telling Ash's story in a way that only she could and she refused to let go of me until the very end.<br/><br/>That's because Ash - A Secret History is one thousand one hundred and thirteen pages of gold.<br/><br/>Ash - A Secret History is comprised of the following parts:<br/><br/>Historically accurate depictions of war from the perspective of a mercenary captain, Ash, in the late medieval era, written by an expert in the field. Mary Gentle has a Master's in War Studies and her love and deep understanding of the late medieval era shows. It's gritty, it's violent, it's dark but more than anything Mary Gentle is committed to writing a story that feels real.<br/><br/><blockquote> The wax candle melted down to a stump.<br/><br/>I'm prisoner here.<br/><br/>This is no Romance of Arthur or Peredur. I'm not about to scale the walls, fight off armoured men with my bare hands, ride off into the sunshine. What happens to valueless prisoners taken in war is pain first, broken bodies second, and an unmarked, unchristian burial afterwards. I am in their city. They own it now. </blockquote><br/><br/>Fantastical / science fiction story beats that appear in the first few pages and continue to unravel in interesting ways as the story goes on.<br/><br/><blockquote> Snow whirled faster from the invisible whiteness of the sky into the glade. Snow covered the green ivy, the red berries of the holly. Snow froze on the spindly brown arcs of briar. A great huffing animal breath came down from the altar of the ruined green chapel. Ash watched its whiteness on the air. Animal-breath hit her in the face, warm and wet.<br/><br/>A great paw trod down from the stone altar. </blockquote><br/><br/>A frame story told from the perspective of a historian in the late 90s translating a manuscript containing Ash's story.<br/><br/>Each chapter of her story is bookended by emails sent between the historian and his agent. As we understand more about Ash's story, revelations made by the historian and his colleagues in the modern era influence our understanding of Ash's story and vice-versa in a never ending corkscrew of revelations and implications.<br/><br/><blockquote> [...] one must remember that exaggeration, legend, myth, and the chronicler's own prejudices and patriotism, all form a normal part of the average mediaeval manuscript. Under the dross, there is gold. As you will see.<br/><br/>History is a large net, with a wide mesh, and many things slip through it into oblivion. With the new material I have uncovered, I hope to bring to light, once again, those facts which do not accord with our idea of the past, but which, nonetheless, are factual.<br/><br/>That this will then involve considerable reassessment of our views of Northern European history is inevitable, and the historians will just have to get used to it!<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing from you,<br/><br/>Pierce Ratcliff </blockquote><br/><br/>A heavy dose of inspiration from long running soap operas featuring a never ending procession of secrets, mysteries and surprises combined with a revolving door of recurring characters that keep coming back no matter what (unless they die horrific deaths on the field of battle of course), always with a surprise or two under their belt.<br/><br/><blockquote> The priest stared. ""You're a woman!""<br/><br/>Ash muttered, ""That's why I keep you on the company books, Godfrey. Your acumen. Your intelligence. The rapidity with which you penetrate to the heart of the matter."" She shot a look at the lantern and its marked hour-candle, burning steadily where it sat on the trestle table. ""It's nearly Nones. Godfrey, go and give that unruly mob out there a field-mass. Do it! I need time."" </blockquote><br/><br/>If anything you've read here has piqued your interest and you're willing to read one book for 40 hours or more, do yourself a favor and pick up a used copy of Ash - A Secret History and enjoy reading through a story unlike anything else you've read.<br/><br/>I've kept this review short and mostly spoiler-free because you deserve to be able go through Mary Gentle's masterpiece blind. I could say so much more but I'll stop myself here and just pray you give this gigantic brick a chance.<br/><br/>Mary Gentle has gained another loyal fan for life. I'm extremely excited to dig into the rest of her work.<br/><br/>NB: Here's some spoilery thoughts I had about the book while I was reading it, kept here for posterity.<br/><br/>Chapter 1:<br/><br/><spoiler> Oof but I'm intrigued. Summoning a mythological lion (God? a god?) and having it lick the protagonist in what seems to be a historical medieval fantasy story was pretty wild. Starting a book with a violent rape of a child followed by her murdering both of her assailants was wild. I don't know what I was expecting from this text before reading it but it wasn't this. </spoiler><br/><br/>200 pages in<br/><br/><spoiler> like wtf is going on here. The mix and match between extremely grounded medieval historical fiction and the fantasy is cool.<br/><br/>I LOVE a good frame story. The historian losing his shit over previously historical documents being categorized as fiction is great. Some real Knights Templar / AssCreed shit, conspiracy shit.<br/><br/>That's cool but then Ash's story cool AF with a healthy dose rollercoaster ride action sequences, suspense, surprises, intrigue, all wrapped in what feels like an authentic-ish medieval war story told from an interesting POV. </spoiler><br/><br/>400 pages in<br/><br/><spoiler> I am continuing to be amazed by Mary Gentle's ability to combine the mundane reality of running a mercenary company in the late 1400s with the fantasy scenes of 500 priests praying and manifesting a blizzard, a Jewish curse making the Sun disappear from an entire part of the world, Ash's ability to communicate with, essentially, a computer versed in military tactics.<br/><br/>The mundanity makes the fantastic more believable somehow.<br/><br/>Also, Ash is not a stereotypical protagonist. Mary Gentle consistently subverts some of the tropes you might expect to see throughout the text. Ash is not a chosen one, she's special in some ways but not in others.<br/><br/>Initially she is portrayed as being a chosen one of some kind and touched by God, a prophet of battle of sorts. But gradually this shifts as our understanding of the world Ash exists in is deepened. My perception of her shifted and made me think that Ash isn't special or fated to achieve great things because she's touched by God, she's just a product of her upbringing and her genes.<br/><br/>But that understanding of Ash clashes with the fantastical elements present within the book which might lead us to believe that this world has one or more beings of great power, gods of some sort, that act on the world as we know it and who's power can't be fully comprehended by the people affected by it.<br/><br/>Or is it just a story within a story? What parts of Ash's story can we believe to be true within the context of the novel when we're told that the historian who's translating the text is telling us that he's watching his archeologist friend unearthing stone golems as described in the novel.<br/><br/>And does it matter?<br/><br/>Whether Ash was licked by a godlike blue lion in her childhood or not, does it matter? Whether Ash is real or not, does it matter?<br/><br/>To be clear she's not real, but that DOESN'T matter.<br/><br/>The entire text is a defense of fiction as a medium and as a fantastic way to express truth about the world we live in and the lives we live.<br/><br/></spoiler>",1

Our ""hero"".<br/><br/><blockquote>""Some of my friends have forgotten they once were Fremen,"" Paul said, speaking to Korba, but designing his words for Stilgar. ""You will mark down the ones Chani identifies as Sardaukar and you will have them killed. Do it yourself. I want it done quietly and without undue disturbance. We must keep in mind that there’s more to religion and government than approving treaties and sermons.</blockquote><br/><br/>Book 1: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780441172719/"">Dune***</a> ★★★★★<br/>Book 2: <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780593098233/"">Dune Messiah***</a> ★★★★<br/><br/>Paul was never a good, as in doing the right thing, kind of character. In Dune, his mother Jessica, as a Bene Gesserit, puts him on the path to become a manufactured messiah destined to cause the deaths of billions of innocent people. We see him fight against this destiny throughout the text but in the end he succumbs to it, takes the crown of the Padishah Emperor and begins his forceful subjugation of the known universe.<br/><br/>In Dune Messiah, 12 years later he's fulfilled the destiny set out for him by the Bene Gesserit, and it's made much more explicit that despite being a Chosen One (albeit a manufactured one), he's not someone we should look up to or seek to emulate.<br/><br/><blockquote>""I am not on Arrakis,"" she said. ""I'm a passenger on a Guild heighliner in free space.""<br/><br/>""There is no such thing as free space, Madame.""<br/><br/>She read hate mingled with profound suspicion in his tone.<br/><br/>""Muad'dib rules everywhere,"" he said.</blockquote><br/><br/>Being disappointed that some readers read Dune and thought otherwise, Frank Herbert went all the way in the sequel to really hit you on the head with Paul's awfulness.<br/><br/><blockquote>""Ghengis ... Khan? Was he of the Sardaukar, m'Lord?""<br/><br/>""Oh, long before that. He killed ... perhaps four million.""<br/><br/>""He must've had formidable weaponry to kill that many, Sire. Las beams, perhaps, or ...""<br/><br/>""He didn't kill them himself, Stil. He killed the way I kill, by sending out his legions. There's another emperor I want you to note in passing—a Hitler. He killed more than six million. Pretty good for those days.""</blockquote><br/><br/>Frank Herbert is skeptical of the great man theory and his Dune series tackles that seriously. Having been steeped in American politics working as a speech writer for US presidents for many years seems to have given Frank Herbert more than just a little skepticism about ""great"" men.<br/><br/>If you were expecting another Hero's Journey from Dune Messiah (even a mocking portrayal or parody of one) after reading Dune's, expect to be disappointed because Dune Messiah is not that. If Dune was all about Paul Atreides's rise to power, Dune Messiah is about his fall. <br/><br/>Dune Messiah luxuriates in the awfulness of Paul and is expecting you to root for the dissidents that are trying to bring his reign to an end despite them being just as awful as Paul (but much less powerful). I don't think that all people in power should be torn down forcefully from their golden thrones but some definitely should and to see this portrayed in fiction, especially in a novel written so many decades ago, is great.<br/><br/>Other writers would have walked back some of the more subversive themes in Dune after it became such a massive hit to sell more copies instead of double downing on these ideas like he did. And the novel is much more interesting because of it.<br/><br/>Frank Herbert is also skeptical of groups (or perhaps he just likes to write about awful people of all kinds). The Bene Gesserit are an all-women organisation that most of the women in the novel belong to. The Bene Gesserit represent a kind of soft power that control people and influence them through relationships, lineages, genes. They are awful. It's not just that they are partially responsible for Paul's rise to power but at every turn they will surprise you with how low they are willing to go in their game of morality Limbo.<br/><br/><blockquote>The Reverend Mother sighed. On the surface, it was the sigh of a prisoner bemoaning her fate, but inwardly she felt the response as a comment on Irulan. It was futile to hope the Atreides Emperor’s precious gene pattern could be preserved through this instrument. No matter her beauty, this Princess was flawed. Under that veneer of sexual attraction lived a whining shrew more interested in words than in actions. Irulan was still a Bene Gesserit, though, and the Sisterhood reserved certain techniques to use on some of its weaker vessels as insurance that vital instructions would be carried out.<br/><br/>Beneath small talk about a softer pallet, better food, the Reverend Mother brought up her arsenal of persuasion and gave her orders: the brother-sister crossbreeding must be explored. (Irulan almost broke at receiving this command.)</blockquote><br/><br/>Frank Herbert is not a luddite but he is concerned with technology's ability to amplify the worst parts of our humanity. This is clearly a concern of his in Dune; refer to the Butlerian Jihad and his treatment of the ""family atomics"" eg. nuclear weapons. Dune Messiah expands on this theme through the Tleilaxu, who are a people with comparatively advanced technology without any pesky morality getting in the way of their technological ""progress"". <br/><br/><blockquote>This was a Tleilaxu thing. The Tleilaxu displayed a disturbing lack of inhibitions in what they created. Unbridled curiosity might guide their actions. They boasted they could make anything from the proper human raw material—devils or saints. They sold killer-mentats. They’d produced a killer medic, overcoming the Suk inhibitions against the taking of human life to do it. Their wares included willing menials, pliant sex toys for any whim, soldiers, generals, philosophers, even an occasional moralist.</blockquote><br/><br/>Like any good work of sci-fi, Dune Messiah, and the series as a whole so far, is like an onion. Under every layer you'll find more ideas to think about and discuss than you might expect. But if you're anything like me, you might find that most of the concerns Frank Herbert had in the 60s when he wrote these books have only gotten more concerning in the intervening decades and, thus, you might find yourself peeling back this onion that is the Dune series and finding more reasons to cry than you might have expected.",1

Chain-Gang All-Stars is NOT one of these kinds of novels. Everything is political but Chain-Gang All-Stars is aggressively so.<br/><br/>The text forces you to think about the topics mentioned above among others, in great detail, and it can be quite depressing. But the premise combined with its execution and the inspirations the text is pulling from act as a lubricant to provide the reader with both a very hard to put down read as well as some deeply upsetting knowledge about how the US oppresses marginalized people.<br/><br/>I was fully immersed in the world presented to me. Adjei-Brenyah's depictions of these dystopian gladiator fights are written such that it's easy to feel like a spectactor in the arena watching these fights from afar, cheering on your favorite contender and cringing when the fight gets bloody.<br/><br/>I felt like I could hear the crowd chanting all around me.<br/><br/><blockquote>Mel—<br/><br/>Her left foot fell first, the midsole landed, and she rolled purposefully to her toes before pushing off again.

She continued the push and switch of her arms and legs, forging speed. Her body told her, This speed, me, your body is your weapon.</blockquote><br/><br/>As we get to know the gladiators more personally, what they have to go through to get where they are and why, it becomes harder to read these fights as unproblematic entertainment. It becomes clear that what these fights actually are, which is private capital funded public executions of society's ""undesirables"" for profit.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/ohno.gif"" width=""200"" height=""100"" /><br/><br/>Other than the initial premise, there's a lot to love in Chain-Gang All-Stars, let's talk about it.<br/><br/>Adjei-Brenyah is an expert at perspective shifting. The story is told from the perspective of many different characters and the way the narrative voice shifts between them is masterful. Initially, it's unclear how all of these characters will fit into the larger narrative. Slowly figuring out how they would eventually collide was quite rewarding.<br/><br/><blockquote>We still resting now. I lie down near enough to the others, fall on a bed of grass. The clothes I wear simple but clean. I used one of my murder points to have a brand I never heard of clean my clothes for me each week. Death becomes laundry. Death becomes food. Death the currency of everything if you let it. And they let it. But since it's there I use it and I have a black shirt and pants to train in and sneakers that fit me and socks and underwear that all smell like pine and soap and the sweat of the March.</blockquote><br/><br/>For a book that has so many characters in it, I'm surprised by how many of them I ended up caring about. Wil and Emily were a particular highlight for me; watching this couple live vicariously through the blood sport content they were consuming was a real pleasure.<br/><br/><blockquote>""What the fuck just happened, babe? What the fuck just fucking happened. Oh my fucking God."" Emily had been bingeing recorded streams again. Wil had wanted to be there when she saw this part so she'd watched with him.</blockquote><br/><br/>The novel has an early 2010s young adult framing that I associate with series like The Hunger Games, yet, the characters are all adults and the text is forcing you to come face to face with the grim reality of living as a marginalized person in the United States constantly.<br/><br/>It's a vibe.<br/><br/>And, to be clear, there's little to no escapism to find here if that's what you're looking for.<br/><br/>Despite writing a near future sci-fi text, Adjei-Brenyah keeps the reader grounded in the reality they live in by regularly presenting them with footnotes, contextually revealing real life statistics or stories about the US's prison-industrial complex, sexual violence, etc. I've never seen footnotes used quite like this in any of the fiction I've read, it's unique.<br/><br/><blockquote>There's a bed and a shit tin. Dark in here most of the day. But they glow in my brain. The hole is black. I only see when the door opens. The door opens one time a day. I sit, sleep, sing, flex, breathe, stretch, shake, cough, shit here. Here is where I come apart.[1]<br/><br/>1: Solitary confinement has been consistently found, nationally and internationally, to induce anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, depression, panic attacks, memory loss, and other cognitive defects.</blockquote><br/><br/>Footnotes are also used to provide poetic epitaphs for almost every person who dies. I thought this was a nice touch, giving Adjei-Brenyah the opportunity to pay respects to characters who've been killed and allow him to make these moments more impactful by reminding the reader of who these characters were and who they could have become if their lives weren't cut short.<br/><br/><blockquote>[...] Seen a lot. Done a lot. Found a home in the hell. She never sold poison to kids, but the poison found the kids anyways, so what was the difference? If you don't have a code you have nothing, and [...] had a code. You swing for your family, you hold your head high, you try to do right when you can. She didn't think she was the love type. She was wrong about that. She found it in hell, a home with love and singing.</blockquote><br/><br/>Chain-Gang All-Stars doesn't provide the reader with all the answers they might be craving for by the end. There's story threads that are left unwoven, but it feels like this was done intentionally. An ending that solved every problem presented in the novel would feel cheap and unearned.<br/><br/>There's no easy solution to breaking down systems of oppression but with the right effort applied by the right people we can change the world and make it a better place to live in for all of us.<br/><br/>Chain-Gang All-Stars has got a lot of real depressing stuff in it but it's also a hopeful story that's about doing the best we can given the circumstances we've been forced into, it's about found family, it's about forgiveness and about loving yourself no matter what.<br/><br/><blockquote>""I learned a long time ago. On this one thing you don't negotiate. You love through all the people you've been and hope you have a chance at being better."" [...] ""What I'm telling you is you can curse yourself to the moon and back and what will it have you feeling like? But try to look at yourself and say 'I love you' and see what happens.""</blockquote><br/><br/>It's pretty good y'all.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/bye.gif"" width=""200"" height=""133"" />",1

It fails completely in its stated goal of being funny.<br/><br/>The tonal clash between the comedic intent of the author and the violent story centered around a group of janitors trying to stop a genocide is jarring.<br/><br/>The characters are nothing more than caricatures and this is a trainwreck waiting to happen given the inclusion of a comic relief autistic character.<br/><br/>His stereotypically autistic behaviors are the punchline of every ""joke"" involving him and it's infuriating. Like genocide, slavery and other topics covered in this book, autism is not inherently funny and the way it's tackled in this book is insulting.<br/><br/>Is the inclusion of a character who reads as autistic inherently bad? No, of course not. It depends on how the character is written and how the author treats them.<br/><br/>For example, Terry Pratchett writes stereotypically autistic characters in his Discworld books (see Thief of Time and Going Postal for some obvious examples of this). But he gets away with it because these stereotypically autistic characters are surrounded by other oddball characters in stories that celebrate being different and celebrate people seeing the world differently than others.<br/><br/>This is the complete opposite of the hate crimes Jim C. Hines commits in this book, where he's constantly punching down, pointing and laughing at the autistic character he's chosen to include in his book.<br/><br/>Clearly this book isn't for me and that's fine. Humor can be very hit and miss, and this book is missing a lot for me.<br/><br/>If I wasn't such a stubborn raging autist, I definitely would have dropped this book like a ton of bricks off a cliff instead of finishing it like an absolute clown.<br/><br/>But here we are.",1

The oppressed people learn about the concept of murder from the Humans and use it to fight back.<br/><br/>Seems like Ursula K. Le Guin is subverting the old school military science fiction trope of humans going around killing ""aliens"" with the humans doing the killing framed as the good guys who we're supposed to be rooting for. Maybe colonialism is bad?<br/><br/><b>soybeansuckers</b> now that's good shit.<br/><br/>It's interesting to read this just after reading Gene Wolfe's The Fifth Head of Cerberus. They were both published in 1972, they've got a lot of themes in common and they were both nominated for Hugo Award for best novella (with Le Guin's The Word for World Is Forest winning the award).<br/><br/>There's no denying that only Gene Wolfe could have written a masterpiece like The Book of the New Sun. But Le Guin's economy of words, using few words to say a lot, is her biggest strength and makes reading her books (barring The Farthest Shore of course) a joy and makes the underlying ideas easier to bring to the surface.<br/><br/>Whereas Wolfe goes out of his way to hide hidden his ideas all throughout his texts, which is interesting in its own way, but sometimes his commitment to obscuring everything in a layer of mystery and complexity can get in the way of telling a compelling story in a compelling way (refer to the Fifth Head of Cerberus).",1

The novel reeks of being written as quickly as Scalzi could after his previous project fell through. I like what I've read of Scalzi's The Interdependency series so far (<a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780765388889/"">thoughts on book 1</a>, <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9780765388971/"">thoughts on book 2</a>) and I like his other work I've read like Redshirts and Old Man's War (although I read those a long time ago).<br/><br/>The Kaiju Preservation Society is not his best work.

She becomes like her namesake from myth who could see into the future but was cursed to never be believed.<br/><br/>Cassandra begins to use her power to change her past, present and future and, in doing so, discovers who she is and who she wants to become.<br/><br/>That's the gist of it. It's a really well told story (with properly thought out time travel mechanics) that will keep you hooked and waiting with expectation to see what happens next.<br/><br/><blockquote>Everything is too far away and too close at the same time, too loud and also too quiet; a yellow door, an orange can, a blue sliver of sky, a dropped navy glove, the red ring around a street sign; a kaleidoscope turning.<br/><br/>A pigeon flaps violently and I put my hands over my face.<br/><br/>It's coming.<br/><br/>It's coming and without my banana muffin there is nothing I can do to stop it.</blockquote><br/><br/>Like a cathartic Greek myth, Cassandra in Reverse has high highs and low lows (and everything in between) that'll make you smile and cry (or at least tear up a little if you're an emotionally stunted man child like me hehehe).<br/><br/>Cassandra reads as autistic from page 1. The dust jacket describes the author as having received an autism diagnosis in 2021. From the very start, it's obvious that Cassandra in Reverse is about autism.<br/><br/>All the challenges Cassandra faces at the start of the novel are the result of her being autistic and living in world (like our own) that is usually unfriendly and, sometimes, outright hostile to people who think and act differently than the majority (including autistic people).<br/><br/>As a fellow autist, I found Cassandra's journey very relatable (not the ""being able to control time"" part but the ""being an autist"" part).<br/><br/>Reading through it and relating Cassandra's struggles to my own gave me a boost of positive energy and good vibes that I was craving. There's something magical about reading a book that feels purposefully written to cater to you and your interests.<br/><br/>Depictions of autism in media are mostly terrible. This skews the public perception of autism making it that much harder to get people to understand what it actually is and how it affects people.<br/><br/>Cassandra in Reverse portrays an autistic character so well that it serves as a crash course into what autism can look like. This depiction can allow readers to gain a better understanding of autism and, in doing so, might lead some readers down the path of diagnosis and, hopefully, a better life.<br/><br/>I can attest to the fact that being autistic and not knowing about it is one of the worst experiences I've lived through (not everybody lives through it).<br/><br/>Everything you do is wrong and you don't understand why. People look at you funny and you don't understand why. You have to fight tooth and nail for things that come naturally to other people.<br/><br/>It can negatively impact every single part of your life and it really sucks.<br/><br/>Once you understand what autism is and how it affects you, you can finally have a chance at leading a life of happiness instead of one of constant alienation.<br/><br/>If reading Cassandra in Reverse is what it takes to make someone go from not knowing about their autism to knowing about it then not only is it a well written novel that'll make you FEEL THINGS (tm) but it's also providing an invaluable service to humanity.<br/><br/>And so, I'm giving it 5 stars and nobody can stop me.",1

If it gets hurt on the job, well too bad, it'll have to figure out how to deal with its injuries on its own.<br/><br/>This is very cyberpunky and I like it.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the novella but the high level of plot-driving stupidity on display from Murderbot's clients this time around prevented me from being as invested in the narrative, compared to All Systems Red.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the interactions between Murderbot and ART though.

Also it's horny but not explicitly so.<br/><br/>This novel is trying to do a little too much IMO and fails to tell a cohesive story that works all the way through as a result.<br/><br/>It's not bad, far from it. It's just inconsistent and a little long.<br/><br/>The setting is cool in theory but in execution I'm left feeling as though it's internally inconsistent (and so, less believable than it could be otherwise).<br/><br/>Words are used in dialogue that don't fit in universe but serve to convey ideas to the 21st century reader. What's the likelihood that people in this universe would say things like: ""Yaaaaassssss""? Probably zero, but characters, especially the main character Gideon, say things like this a lot.<br/><br/>Gideon feels like she's been transported straight from our modern day into this universe that's completely unlike our own. I LIKE her but I wish she was in another novel. She exists to be relatable to the reader and that's fine I guess but her existence is so dissonant that it's hard to ignore.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the murder mystery. This novel is Agatha Christie-esque in that all the characters are invited to a gothic palace and are asked to investigate (compete?) in a quest to become gods. People start dying and we're supposed to care (but it's kind of hard to).<br/><br/>Throughout most of the story, we're as lost and confused as Gideon is (so A LOT). I haven't read enough murder mysteries to know if this sort of clueless POV can work, it doesn't work here.<br/><br/>Let's talk about relationships. Gideon's relationship with Harrow is hard to believe and how it evolves over time even harder. They start out hating each other and as time goes by, for no discernible reason, they become closer and transform into frenemies, then friends and then... Something else.<br/><br/>Their relationship is undeniably toxic in SO MANY ways, which is fine, but I find it hard to believe that either of these characters would want to be in the same room with one another.<br/><br/>What do I like about this book?<br/>- Gideon is cool (but she should be in another book).<br/>- The setting is cool (but certain details are inconsistent with the rest of what's presented and throw me off, eg. What is the economic system that is supplying the Ninth's Tomb planet with the titty mags and comic books that Gideon reads? Who's producing them and why?)<br/>- The location of the murder mystery is cool (but it's told from the perspective of a clueless character who just walks around, hangs out, then sometimes people die and eventually someone explains to her what's actually happening).<br/><br/>I'm conflicted on this one. I think if this book had sex in it instead of just being undeniably horny at all times maybe that would push me over the edge and get me to recommend this book.<br/><br/>As-is though, Gideon the Ninth suffers from enough ""First Author's Book Syndrome"" (a lot of small-ish problems that add up) that I can't recommend it. Although, it's got enough going for it that I would consider getting the second novel in the series on sale and seeing if some of my complaints are addressed.<br/><br/>The more distance I have from this book the more I feel I was a little nitpicky and unfair to it.<br/><br/>I like A LOT about it.<br/><br/>I'm excited to read the sequels which I've heard great things about.",1

A torturer? You may leave the guild, you know, if you prefer.""<br/><br/>I told him firmly — and as though I were slightly shocked by the suggestion — that I had never considered it. It was a lie. I had known, as all the apprentices knew, that one was not firmly and finally a member of the guild until one consented as an adult to the connection. Furthermore, though I loved the guild I hated it too — not because of the pain it inflicted on clients who must sometimes have been innocent, and who must often have been punished beyond anything that could be justified by their offences; but because it seemed to me inefficient and ineffectual, serving a power that was not only ineffectual but remote. I do not know how better to express my feelings about it than by saying that I hated it for starving and humiliating me and loved it because it was my home, hated and loved it because it was the exemplar of old things, because it was weak, and because it seemed indestructible.</blockquote><br/><br/>An older Severian, sitting on his throne, starts writing the story of his life and how he came into the position of power he's, presumably, currently in. The story begins as a coming of age story with Severian describing his youth as a journeyman in the Torturer's Guild. Eventually, he leaves the Tower he has called home for his entire life and embarks on an adventure becoming an executioner for hire where he roams around, kills people for the state, meets a diverse cast of characters and discovers the, absolutely wild, world he lives in.<br/><br/>Gene Wolfe is known for writing stories from the perspective of characters deeply embedded in the narrative. His Book of the New Sun is no exception. Severian doesn't ever do any exposition or go out his way to explain facets of his world that are obvious to him and obvious to the fictional audience he's writing the story for.<br/><br/>Also, Severian is biased, he disguises the truth, he's not always paying attention to what he should be paying attention to and he can't tell the difference between his memories and his dreams.<br/><br/>All of this puts you as the reader in a state of perpetual confusion and forces you to constantly interpret the events, and re-interpret past events, in the novel as you are exposed to more and more contextual information and details revealed by Severian. This framing for the story combined with the far future setting as well Severian's, let's just say unreliability as a narrator, makes for a compelling read.<br/><br/>The meta-ness of it all with Gene Wolfe writing a story about a torturer in a far future for us, the current day, reader, with this torturer writing about himself from his biased and insane perspective for his audience is very compelling.<br/><br/>I could spend hours discussing any randomly chosen paragraph from the first half of the Book of the New Sun. It's dense, multi-faceted and layered unlike anything I've ever read. It's begging to be read multiple times over which I'm already planning to do despite only being halfway through the series as I write this.<br/><br/>The first part of the The Book of the New Sun was published in 1980, way before the era of trigger warnings in novels. If you're sensitive to that, please inform yourself ahead of time before diving into this series because it's grim as hell and contains many events and themes that some people might find uncomfortable (and understandably so).<br/><br/>Barring that, I can recommend this series, or at least what I've read of it so far, to anyone interested in high concept yet grounded sci-fi/fantasy stories.",1

Having to live with someone with a hoarding issue is something I've experienced and it's nice to see an author attempt, and mostly succeed, at depicting it well from the perspective of the hoarder.<br/><br/>The alien life is alien but the revellation of what it really is and what it's doing is not delivered to the reader in a satisfying way. It's a little too slow and I don't care about it all that much. Knowing what it is lessens my interest in it.",1

Although that's mostly true, I don't think this book needs one.<br/><br/>This is a story about people, it focuses on them and their evolving relationships with one another, finding common ground despite their differences. That's more than enough to keep someone enraptured for however long it takes them to read the book (I know I was).<br/><br/>But if you're looking for a story about a ragtag group of underdogs overcoming stacked odds to save the universe, you'll have to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something a little bit out there, and are ok with reading something with less action, less sex (although there is some of that) and fewer universe ending apocalypses than you're used to, then I can highly recommend this book.<br/><br/>Here be spoilers, you've been warned:<br/><spoiler><br/>The book has an optimistic tone but it isn't wishy-washy when it comes to the grittier topics it tackles. For example, one of the characters, Speaker, is a member of a species that is very clearly a stand-in for Jewish people (systemically oppressed/enslaved, forced to be nomads with no land to call their own, etc).<br/><br/>NB: I would love to hear an expert talk about this portrayal. I can't point fingers necessarily but I definitely raise an eyebrow at the author's choice to portray the Jewish stand-in race as tiny gremlins with hooks for hands.<br/><br/>This book doesn't shy away from portraying the systemic discrimination that Speaker and her species is subjected to. By the end of the book, systemic discrimination isn't ""solved"" but the characters come to terms with their differences, their prejudice and tackle them head on.<br/><br/>This lines up with real world social psychology theories on how to go about successfully breaking down barriers and achieving understanding and compassion between different groups of people. My knowledge of the social psychology behind this combined with this portrayal helped make this story feel believable to me.<br/><br/>One minor complaint I have is that every character has a tragic backstory (or is going through puberty) that is revealed over the course of the book. It feels a little melodramatic but I eventually got over it. Because of this and the fact that most ""scenes"" involve characters standing around and talking to each other, the novel feels more like a dramatic play than a book. This isn't a bad thing, it's just something I noticed.<br/><br/>I think we're going to see a lot of authors copy Becky Chambers's writing style in the coming years. What she's doing in this book seems like a recipe for success and I expect her to cash in on this format, rightfully so. And I'm excited to read the other books she's written in this series, the rest of her work.<br/><br/></spoiler>",1

I actually laughed out loud quite a few times and that's something i cherish because writing comedic novels is anything but easy.<br/><br/>The novel has a unique voice that might rub some people the wrong way. The way that the many run-on sentences were written gave the text an almost lyrical vibe that felt like a good fit given the premise of the book.<br/><br/>I would have given Space Opera a 5/5 but unfortunately I feel as though the book would have benefited greatly from more of a focus on the main character Danesh and his partner in crime Oort. Spending more time with them, experiencing their newly expanded world (filled with many alien aliens) from their perspective would have been great. Instead, many chapters are spent describing in detail the events/winners of past Metagalactic Grand Prix(s).<br/><br/>These chapters are fine in isolation but, within the context of the rest of the novel, they clash with the more personal chapters preceding and following them leading to a less fulfilling read (at least for me).<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend Space Opera if you're looking for something light, that might make you smile and chuckle more than you would expect.",1

I haven't said anything in five minutes, because I've been stuck here in an interminable internal monologue that nobody wants to read. God help me...<br/><br/>Heavy sigh.<br/><br/>This book is OK. I think with more time in the oven and some heavy editing it could have been fantastic.<br/><br/>As-is it was really challenging to get through. In particular, the way aliens are handled is heinous.<br/><br/>I almost threw the book across the room when Nine Hibiscus, a military leader in charge of thousands of soldiers, dunked her unprotected hands into the corpse of an unknown alien species.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on when the first question she asks to the medical examiner is the following: ""Are they mammals?""<br/><br/>Nine Hibiscus, please, these aliens seem to have access to technology that may greatly surpass your own. They annihilated hordes of your empire's military like they were ants.<br/><br/>I don't think it's relevant to ask if the alien being in front of you secretes milk out of its breasts.<br/><br/>I've been poisoned by reading Adrian Tchaikovsky's depiction of aliens in his Children of Time series and his The Final Architecture series.<br/><br/>It's done so well in these novels and comparing those depictions with what we get here makes A Desolation Called Peace look real bad.<br/><br/>I'm frustrated and I'm not sure reading more of this book will help with that.<br/><br/>Reading through more of this book, I don't think Arkady Martine knows what a mammal is or how arbitrary of a distinction it is in the context of her story.<br/><br/>Her characters definitely don't. I cannot believe that the mammal fixation is brought up a second time.<br/><br/>If they're mammals we'll be able to speak with them? Ehhhhhhhhhh<br/><br/>A rushed sequel for a book that greatly surpassed expectations and achieved massive critical success.<br/><br/>The constant inconsistencies, the atrocious way the aliens are handled and described is unbelievably bad, the characters's internal monologues going on and on about nothing relevant.<br/><br/>All of this is exhausting. I enjoyed the previous book in the series despite having a few gripes with it but this one is not a great follow up.<br/><br/>I think it succeeds in some ways. Now that the reader is more familiar with the universe, Martine feels comfortable writing the sequel from multiple POVs, in doing so gives herself the opportunity to give us a better sampling of the world.<br/><br/>Does she succeed fully with this? No. The POVs aren't different enough from one another.<br/><br/>But the book feels forced in a way I haven't seen in a novel in a long time. The author starts off with a message about the book being for/by outsiders. But it's not, it tries to be but it's super forced and is coming not from within the story but from without.<br/><br/>Is this a cynical attempt to capture a particular audience? Maybe? I think it's more likely that Martine doesn't understand that good sci fi comes from imagining worlds that are different from our own and seeing how those differences change things and what it might mean for us.<br/><br/>Instead Martine seems to believe that good sci fi is about creating an interesting world and then moving characters from point A to B while they constantly have temper tantrums, eternally question themselves and their skills and fend off assassination attempts.<br/><br/>Every sentence spoken by a character is followed by interminable internal monologuing. Clearly writing like this comes naturally to Martine and sometimes it works but it's too much here.<br/><br/>It's excruciating to read and completely understand someone DNFing this book midway through.<br/><br/>This novel needed more time in the oven and it would have been way better.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a tad satirical. Don't take me too seriously but please do think twice about reading this novel, even if you really enjoyed the previous one. You might be disappointed like I was.<br/><br/>Here's a few reasons why you might give A Desolation Called Peace by Arkady Martine a 5 star review.<br/>- It won the Hugo award for best novel, just like the previous book in the series. Other people seem to like it, I guess I should like it too?<br/>- Both books in the series combined come out to about 1 thousand pages. After spending that much time with a series, it must be good because otherwise look at all this time I've wasted (Sunk Cost Fallacy)<br/>- I really loved A Memory Called Empire, I guess I like the sequel too?<br/><br/>I respect your point of view even if you disagree with mine. But it's so confusing to me, seeing so many people give this novel a perfect score and gush about it, while completely neglecting the aspects of it that are objectively bad.<br/><br/>This novel feels extremely rushed, it likely was rushed out the door by the publisher so that they could most efficiently capitalize on the unexpected acclaim received by the first book. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel after all.<br/><br/>NB: We do live under capitalism. It is what it is.<br/><br/>All the signs of a rushed release are there if you look closely.<br/>1. Awkward run-on sentences are everywhere and cause the reader psychic damage trying to get through them.<br/><br/>Read the following excerpt out loud to see what I mean:<br/><br/><blockquote>The water she'd drunk made her able to talk [author's note: this sentence is atrocious]. Even sing one of the absurd pitched-consonant words that they'd picked up from the aliens in demonstration for the yaotlek, though Mahit was so much better at making those noises that Three Seagrass had begun to plan a scheme in which she taught her how to have some halfway-decent breath and pitch control, pass on the lessons she'd had as a crèche-kid in how to project from the diaphragm when orating.</blockquote><br/><br/>Reading this novel closely, you can and will find many sentences just like this peppered all throughout the text and reading them will drive you insane.<br/><br/>I hate this kind of writing. I don't know where it comes from. It goes against everything I know about good writing. It drives me up the wall.<br/><br/>NB: If you're like me, I highly recommend you also stay away from Ann Leckie's The Raven Tower which suffers from the same kind of long winded writing.<br/>2. The novel has multiple POV characters and their narratorial voices are way too similar and this will encourage you to start drinking, heavily.<br/><br/>Each bit of dialogue, no matter which character's POV we're following, is interspersed with an ungodly amount of stream of consciousness blahblahblah text that is really annoying to read.<br/><br/>If one character was written like this, it's all good. This narration style would define the character and make them unique, and it wouldn't be so overbearing.<br/><br/>The problem is that every single POV character is written like this because I guess that's how Arkady Martine writes and her editor was not given the time and support they needed this time to take out the trash.<br/><br/>Let's look at some examples:<br/><br/><blockquote>Mahit said, ""Well, that's unexpectedly pleasant, all considered,"" and didn't go on any further. She didn't want to—she couldn't tell Three Seagrass that she was here to spy on the war for Darj Tarats, in order to escape Aknel Amnardbat's surgeons. To do worse things for Darj Tarats, if there was an opportunity. She couldn't. So she got into the shuttle instead, settling amongst the supply crates and strapping herself into some freefall-control webbing. There were similar webbings on all of the walls, the floor, the ceiling. It was an efficie""t, well-designed ship. It must make a hundred of these short hops in a month— ""Quite,"" said Three Seagrass, all edges, interest and wariness and a sort of invitation deferred: We can play, Mahit, even if we don't play just now, if playing's what you want.</blockquote><br/><br/>Notice that Arkady Martine explicitly cuts off Mahit's stream of consciousness narration here.<br/><br/>This paragraph is actually cool because there's an intentionality to it. The reader is meant to understand that Mahit is someone who is often stuck in her own head. That's awesome characterization.<br/><br/>The issue is that this narrative voice bleeds into every other character's POV.<br/><br/>For example, in this excerpt, Nine Hibiscus has just been informed by a subordinate that the alien's planet has been found.<br/><br/><blockquote>""If we can get there without them seeing us,"" Nine Hibiscus said. The scatterbombs would do exactly what Eighteen Chisel was imagining. They would, yes, blow anyone out of their sky. And then they'd poison that sky, and the planets below it. The scatterbombs were deathrain. A last resort. Almost never used where people lived— because after them, people didn't live there anymore. She'd only used a scatterbomb barrage once, and that had been against another ship, safe in the blackness of space. The idea of using them on the aliens was— She liked it too much, was what. Liked it too much, too fast. Such a simple solution. So much easier than the rest of the situation she'd been detailing for herself.</blockquote><br/><br/>Huuuuuuuhhhh. Does this sound familiar? If you replace the names in these excerpts, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.<br/><br/>Notice how frequently Arkady Martine uses the ""—"" (em dash) to cut off her character's neverending internal monologues.<br/><br/>You might be wondering, how did I find these examples? Did I carefully sift truth the entire book for the perfect example to present a skewed representation of the book to make my argument more convincing?<br/><br/>No, I opened my book at a random page and found relevant examples each time because the book is filled with them.<br/>3. Final thoughts because reading this book makes me not want to think anymore.<br/><br/>Reading through A Desolation Called Peace has driven me to the brink of insanity and so I find myself ready and able to talk shit about any part of it.<br/>- Arkady Martine's ignorance about biology and linguistics and her decision to hinge her entire novel on these topics that she clearly knows less than nothing about is infuriating.<br/>- Her fixation on the fact that these aliens are mammals (well sort of, wink wink) and how apparently that ISN'T a completely arbitrary distinction to make is wild. If these aliens secret milk out of their breasts, have vertebra and shit, it is not plot critical, please do not fixate on their mammalness.<br/>- Don't get me started on the title of the novel. Cynically, I understand the sequel of a popular book should probably use a similar naming scheme to the first novel to make it clear that it's a sequel and in doing so sell more copies. But, come on, A Desolation Called Peace, is real dumb.<br/><br/>I feel betrayed by the Goodreads and the science fiction community at large for promoting the apparent perfection of this novel.<br/><br/>Although, there are some heroes out there (you know who you are) who knew the truth and tried their best to communicate it, mostly falling on deaf ears.<br/><br/>I should have listened. Maybe then I wouldn't be headed straight for the mental asylum.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a little satirical, please be chill<br/><br/>NB: p. 404, O face due to great diplomacy by Mahit<br/><br/>I've written more than three thousand words between five different first drafts trying to explain exactly why reading A Desolation Called Peace made me so angry. Instead of fumbling with my words, I'll let Ursula K. Le Guin speak for me (quote taken from her essay The Stalin in the Soul).<br/><br/><blockquote>Reading is not a passive reaction, but an action, involving the mind, the emotions, and the will. To accept trashy books because they are ""best-sellers"" is the same thing as accepting adulterated food, ill-made machines, corrupt government, and military and corporative tyranny, and praising them, and calling them the American Way of Life or the American Dream. It is a betrayal of reality. Every betrayal, every lie accepted, leads to the next betrayal and the next lie.</blockquote><br/><br/>Suffice to say that I feel <b>betrayed</b>.<br/><br/>It's clear to me from reading this book closely, that it was rushed to the printing press in an attempt to capitalize on the unexpected (but mostly deserved) acclaim received by the previous book in the series, A Memory Called Empire. With a bit more time in the oven, the sequel could have been fantastic, and yet here we are.<br/><br/>Open the book on any page, put your finger anywhere to find:<br/>- Omnipresent awkward run-on sentences that are begging to be trimmed by a competent editor.<br/>- Multiple POV characters who all suffer from the same never ending stream of consciousness narrative voice that is a pain to read.<br/>- Some absolutely baffling ignorance about aliens, linguistics, the definition of the word ""spy"" and basic biology.<br/><br/>I've rated the book 1 star although it's probably deserving of more (maybe a 2 or a 3), but I need to fight the good fight and do my part to pull this book back into the void where it belongs.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed A Desolation Called Peace, great! Maybe you even rated it 5 stars? Fantastic. I'm truly glad you enjoyed it.<br/><br/>But are you sure that you're really being honest with yourself?<br/><br/>If you don't want to hear what I have to say, fine, but at least listen to Chad Le Guin. If we continue to accept slop like this, praise its greatness, and put it on a pedestal, publishers have no incentive to give authors and editors the time they need to do their best work.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm wrong? Maybe this is really one of the best sci-fi novels of our generation? Maybe the author and the editor and everyone involved got all the time they needed to make A Desolation Called Peace the best it could be.<br/><br/>Well then, if A Desolation Called Peace is the peak of what modern sci-fi can bring to the table, I don't want to read it anymore.",1

It follows in the footsteps of the first two books by giving us another story about characters (various uplifted species, human/AI constructs and one fungi species) being thrust together onto another planet.<br/><br/>As per usual, hijinks ensue.<br/></spoiler><br/>||| Spoilers how the story is told |||<br/><spoiler><br/><br/>I think that the two previous books had better pacing and were more interesting rollercoaster rides. This one isn't bad per say but I didn't like it as much. The story is told out of order and that's usually a hard sell for me (although I did appreciate being told when/where the chapters were taking place in the timeline).<br/><br/>Children of Memory fell a little flat for me because I prefer novels that don't withhold information from the reader to inject mystery and intrigue into a story instead of just telling an interesting story in the first place. Children of Memory feels more like an M. Night.

There's a few chapters that feel pretty miserable to read because they're sort of remixes of previous chapters (the child POV also didn't really help with this). At times it felt like Adrian was padding out the page count instead of trying to tell an interesting story.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed reading through Children of Memory. I applaud it for being a little avant garde in terms of how the story is told but I'm not sure that it completely sticks the landing.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the series or you're interested in unpacking some of the philosophical questions raised by the book, I can recommend it.<br/><br/><blockquote>""You don't think what they have here, their culture, their traditions, is worth preserving?""

Getting to know the translators and how they fit into the bigger picture was enjoyable even though some of them really suck.<br/><br/>I don't tend to like mystery novels much. The Extinction of Irena Rey is the first mystery novel I've enjoyed without any caveats. The mystery that begins to reveal itself as you read the text is not constantly thrown in your face which I appreciated.<br/><br/>Instead, the mystery is the kettle on the stove all these translators are swimming in and butting heads in.

It doesn't stick the landing IMO.<br/><br/>Iain Banks is the only writer I can think of who I can think of that can get away with writing a 6 page long expositional monologue explaining exactly how the Culture, Iain Bank's far future utopian human civilization run by AI, deals with autocrats on pre-Culture planets AND makes it not only interesting morally and philosophically, but funny (and I mean really funny as in haha laugh out loud funny).<br/><br/>The start of Use of Weapons in comparison when compared with the two previous Culture books, Consider Phlebas and the Player of Games, is more obviously a comedy of some sort. I've heard Iain Banks's Culture series exemplifying a movie-esque writing style and the more I read of it the more I agree.<br/><br/>The prologue of Use of Weapons featuring two soldiers of some kind, Cullis and Zackelwe, sleeping off a hangover and drinking, respectively, while under active artillery fire exemplifies this. The mastery of comedic timing, which is rarely attempted in novels because of how difficult it is to succeed at, the writing style focusing on certain visual elements in a scene moving from one to the next all combine to give a feeling of watching a movie with a camera that's being guided by Iain Banks hand.<br/><br/>Funny and philosophical, the combination of both is what Iain Banks achieves with his writing and what makes it so unique.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Two timelines interspersed. One told chronologically and the other told in reverse, for the most part, there's also further back flashbacks. Both about a character known as Zakalwe, a commando/general/fixer working for Special Circumstances at the edges of Culture-space.<br/><br/>It's ambitious and doesn't live up to the expectations that are. It suffers from being one of Iain Banks's earlier works written in the 70s that he took a second shot at a decade and half later.<br/><br/>The way the story is told has its moments but it doesn't end up being worth the confusion added.

He had to have them on his side. There was no other way he could carry out his mission, and he had come too far, done too much, killed too many people, sunk too much of his own purpose and determination into the task, to back out now. He had to track the Mind down, he had to go down into the Command System, Idirans or no Idirans, and he had to have the rest of [them] with him.</blockquote><br/><br/>A long time ago in a galaxy without any post-scarcity societies managed by hyper-intelligent AIs (to my knowledge), I read Consider Phlebas once, liked it a lot but, at the time, I wasn't aware that it was part of a larger series so I didn't seek the other books out.<br/><br/>Many years later, I forgot that I had previously Consider(ed) Phlebas, so I picked the book up again, quickly realizing that I had already read it but I decided to continue reading it anyway because I had enjoyed it a lot the first time. Now, I was aware of the Culture series and was interested in reading more of it but I never did.<br/><br/>Many many years later, like now, I realized that reading brings me a lot more joy than I thought it did and so now I spend more of my free time reading because I enjoy it so much. I want to read more of Iain Banks's Culture books, so here we are, re-Consider(ing) Phlebas a third time and it's better than ever.<br/><br/>First things first. Who are we considering exactly? In T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land Phlebas is a drowned sailor who, apparently (I don't know I'm not a poet), represents the futility of death and decay.<br/><br/>Appropriately, Consider Phlebas, the Iain Banks novel, is an anti-war anti-narrative satire of science fiction and space opera stories. Consider Phlebas depicts the meaninglessness of war (instead of valorizing it) through the lens of an anti-hero who mostly sucks, is a conspiracy theorist and, perhaps worst of all given the premise of The Culture books, is a humanoid-focused materialist with a distrust and hatred for the AI intelligences that manage a big chunk of the universe.<br/><br/><blockquote>He looked for the Culture ship, then told himself not to be stupid; it was probably still several trillion kilometres away. That was how divorced from the human scale modern warfare had become. You could smash and destroy from unthinkable distances, obliterate planets from beyond their own system and provoke stars into novae from light-years off... and still have no good idea why you were really fighting.</blockquote><br/><br/>It's not usually preachy and yet contains a lot of philosophical ideas that you can spend a lot of time unpacking if you're into that. I rarely re-read books, there's not enough time in the day for that, but there are some books like Consider Phlebas or <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781250781253"">Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun</a> that are so dense that they're begging to be.<br/><br/><blockquote>'Don't you have a religion?' Dorolow asked Horza.<br/><br/>'Yes,' he replied, not taking his eyes away from the screen on the wall above the end of the main mess-room table. 'My survival.'<br/><br/>'So... your religion dies with you. How sad,' Dorolow said, looking back from Horza to the screen. The Changer let the remark pass.<br/><br/>The exchange had started when Dorolow, struck by the beauty of the great Orbital, expressed the belief that even though it was a work of base creatures, no better than humans, it was still a triumphant testimony to the power of God, as God had made Man, and all other souled creatures. Horza had disagreed, genuinely annoyed that the woman could use even something so obviously a testament to the power of intelligence and hard work as an argument for her own system of irrational belief.</blockquote><br/><br/>It has the trappings of the genres it's making fun of; some scenes are played straight so unless you're told beforehand that Consider Phlebas is a satire you might not realize it is one until you're halfway through the book. The overarching theme of the meaninglessness of war permeates throughout the entire text and this makes it hard to ignore the satirical tone.<br/><br/><blockquote>They had flown through the scattered stars without encountering anything out of the ordinary: no messages or signals, no distant flashes from battles, no warp wakes. The area around them seemed calm and undisturbed, as though all that was happening was what always happened: just the stars being born and dying, the galaxy revolving, the holes twisting, the gases swirling. The war, in that hurried silence, in their false rhythm of day and night, seemed like something they had all imagined, an inexplicable nightmare they had somehow shared, even escaped.</blockquote><br/><br/>It's got a little bit of everything in it (even some light romance) but don't be surprised when things go a little awry. It's a grim story but it does have many lighter moments; if you're anything like me you'll find yourself chuckling a lot throughout the text. Iain Banks will set up a joke and he'll pay it off 100 pages later with an extremely delayed punchline.<br/><br/><blockquote>He could see some of the others not far away, to his left and right, pushing and striding through the cane grass and bushes with their rifles held high to one shoulder. They were all gradually getting covered in the dark green moss, which Horza supposed might be useful as camouflage (providing, of course, that it didn't turn out to be some horrible, previously undiscovered sentient killer-moss... He told himself to stop being silly).</blockquote><br/><br/>If you're OK with reading a novel that both deconstructs a genre that you may know and love while also taking the piss, you should consider Consider Phlebas.<br/><br/>This might be the last time I re-re-Consider Phlebas for a while, I'll be quite busy reading the other NINE books in the series.<br/><br/>Auuuuasaauuuuaaauuuhhhhhhhhh",1

'She had me dressed up in a suit, toting a gun and shooting at toy missiles which ""explosively dismantled"" themselves.'<br/><br/>'You didn't enjoy it.'<br/><br/>'Not at all. I had high hopes for that girl, but too much of that sort of nonsense and I think her intelligence will explosively dismantle.'<br/><br/>'Well, such diversions aren't for everybody. She was just trying to be helpful. You'd said you were feeling restless, looking for something new.'<br/><br/>'Well, that wasn't it,' Gurgeh said, and felt suddenly, inexplicably, saddened.<br/></blockquote><br/>Gurgeh has studied and played all the games that exist and none no one can provide him with a challenge. He's sad because he's bored. The Culture might be a post-scarcity society but that doesn't mean that they've completely eliminated unhappiness, they've just reduced its likelihood.<br/><br/><blockquote> 'All reality is a game. Physics at its most fundamental, the very fabric of our universe, results directly from the interaction of certain fairly simple rules, and chance; the same description may be applied to the best, most elegant and both intellectually and aesthetically satisfying games. By being unknowable, by resulting from events which, at the sub-atomic level, cannot be fully predicted, the future remains malleable, and retains the possibility of change, the hope of coming to prevail; victory, to use an unfashionable word. In this, the future is a game; time is one of the rules. Generally, all the best mechanistic games - those which can be played in any sense ""perfectly"", such as grid, Prallian scope, 'nkraytle, chess, Farnic dimensions - can be traced to civilisations lacking a relativistic view of the universe (let alone the reality). They are also, I might add, invariably pre-machine sentience societies.<br/><br/>'The very first-rank games acknowledge the element of chance, even if they rightly restrict raw luck. To attempt to construct a game on any other lines, no matter how complicated and subtle the rules are, and regardless of the scale and differentiation of the playing volume and the variety of the powers and attributes of the pieces, is inevitably to shackle oneself to a conspectus which is not merely socially but techno-philosophically lagging several ages behind our own. As a historical exercise it might have some value. As a work of the intellect, it's just a waste of time. If you want to make something old-fashioned, why not build a wooden sailing boat, or a steam engine? They're just as complicated and demanding as a mechanistic game, and you'll keep fit at the same time.' </blockquote><br/><br/>Gurgeh reciting his past work on games, specifically talking about his preference for games with luck in them because they more accurately reflect the world we live in. If we're to believe that the games we play reflect on the societies we live in and vice-versa, games without luck are bad because that's not how the real world works and it never will. Playing and thinking about games like that will teach us the wrong lessons about the world we live in.<br/><br/><blockquote> The game went on. People came and went around him. The web held all his fortune; the little spheres, holding their secret treasures and threats, became like discrete parcels of life and death, single points of probability which could be guessed at but never known until they were challenged, opened, looked at. All reality seemed to hinge on those infinitesimal bundles of meaning. </blockquote><br/><br/>There are times when the game we're playing, the fiction we're reading or any kind of abstraction of the real world we're immersing ourself in, becomes more important than anything else.<br/><br/><blockquote> Three days passed. He couldn't settle to anything. He tried to read papers, old books, the material of his own he'd been working on - but on every occasion he found himself reading and re-reading the same piece or page or screen, time and time again, trying hard to take it in but finding his thoughts constantly veering away from the words and diagrams and illustrations in front of him, refusing to absorb anything, going back time and time again to the same treadmill, the same looping, tail-swallowing, eternally pointless round of questioning and regret. Why had he done it? What way out was there? </blockquote><br/><br/>When I'm reading, I try to clear my mind and focus on what's on the page but sometimes, no matter what I do, my brain refuses to parse the words on the page, and would rather think about anything else. I acknowledge these moments and try my best to deal with them effectively, either by making a plan to solve whatever problem my mind is stuck thinking about, or by putting the book down and doing some journalling to let these thoughts out onto the page and hopefully in doing so keep them from bouncing around in my mind forever.<br/><blockquote><br/>'I think I see Shohobohaum Za in the crowd,' the drone said as they waited at the exit. Ram's entourage was still cluttering the far end of the ribbon of path held clear by the two lines of policemen.<br/><br/>Gurgeh glanced at the machine, then down the line of arm-linked police. He was still tensed from the game, bloodstream suffused with multifarious chemicals. As happened every now and again, everything he saw around him seemed to be part of the game; the way people stood like pieces, grouped according to who could take or affect whom; the way the pattern on the marquee was like a simple grid-area on the board, and the poles like planted power-sources waiting to replenish some exhausted minor piece and supporting a crux-point in the game; the way the people and police stood like the suddenly closed jaws of some nightmarish pincer-movement… all was the game, everything was seen in its light, translated into the combative imagery of its language, evaluated in the context its structure imposed upon the mind. </blockquote><br/><br/>When you're really immersed in a game and playing it more than you probably should, it's common for those same neurons to start firing when you're not playing the game. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect"">Tetris effect</a> is a common example of this.<br/><br/><blockquote> Anyway, he was awash with a bitter-sweet flood of new and enhanced emotions; the terror of risk and possible defeat, the sheer exultation of the gamble that paid off and the campaign which triumphed; the horror of suddenly seeing a weakness in his position which could lose him the game; the surge of relief when nobody else noticed and there was time to plug the gap; the pulse of furious, gloating glee when he saw such a weakness in another's game; and the sheer unbridled joy of victory. </blockquote><br/><br/>Playing games at a high level and trying your best to win can make you feel like a god.<br/><br/><blockquote> Gurgeh saw many cripples. They sat on street corners, selling trinkets, playing music on scratchy, squeaky instruments, or just begging. Some were blind, some had no arms, some had no legs. Gurgeh looked at the damaged people and felt dizzy; the gritty surface of the street beneath him seemed to tip and heave. For a moment it was as though the city, the planet, the whole Empire swirled around him in a frantic spinning tangle of nightmare shapes; a constellation of suffering and anguish, an infernal dance of agony and mutilation. </blockquote><br/><br/>Ah yes. Living in America, <b>an infernal dance of agony and mutilation</b>.<br/><br/><blockquote> 'Good,' Hamin nodded. 'You see, Gurgeh, one can be on either side in the Empire. One can be the player, or one can be… played upon.' Hamin smiled at what was a play on words in Eächic, and to some extent in Marain too. </blockquote><br/><br/>Everything is a game, or at least can be thought of as a game. Life is a game, an unfair one sadly, and every aspect of it can be thought of as a game. There's a set of rules defined by the physical world around us and the societies we live in. You can't choose to NOT play the game, and if you do you're likely to get played yourself.<br/><br/>If you start off in a privileged position and you can use the rules to your advantage, you're winning. Otherwise, you might not be.<br/><br/>We're all _Morat_, The Player of Games in our own lives. And, I think that's part of why this book is so good. We're all gamers.<br/><br/><blockquote> Gurgeh watched Groasnachek as it fell away beneath them. The city tilted as he was thrown back into his seat; the whole view swung and juddered as the shuttlecraft powered into the hazy skies.<br/><br/>Gradually all the patterns and the shapes came out, revealed for a while before the increasing distance, the city's own vapours, dust and grime, and the altering angle of their climb took it all away.<br/><br/>For all the jumble, it looked momentarily peaceful and ordered in its parts. The distance made its individual, local confusions and dislocations disappear, and from a certain height, where little ever dallied, and almost everything just passed through, it looked exactly like a great, mindless, spreading organism. </blockquote><br/><br/>Iain Banks's ability to write fantastic prose, bring up interesting philosophical conundrums without being preachy about his own beliefs AND tell stories that hook you and never let go, all within the same novel consistently amazes me.<br/><blockquote><br/>So far so average. Our game-player's lucked out again. I guess you can see he's a changed man, though. These humans! I'm going to be consistent, however. I haven't told you who I am so far, and I'm not going to tell you now, either. Maybe later.<br/><br/>Maybe.<br/><br/>Does identity matter anyway? I have my doubts. We are what we do, not what we think. Only the interactions count (there is no problem with free will here; that's not incompatible with believing your actions define you). And what is free will anyway? Chance. The random factor. If one is not ultimately predictable, then of course that's all it can be. I get so frustrated with people who can't see this!<br/><br/>Even a human should be able to understand it's obvious.<br/><br/>The result is what matters, not how it's achieved (unless, of course, the process of achieving is itself a series of results). What difference does it make whether a mind's made up of enormous, squidgy, animal cells working at the speed of sound (in air!), or from a glittering nanofoam of reflectors and patterns of holographic coherence, at lightspeed? (Let's not even think about a Mind mind.) Each is a machine, each is an organism, each fulfils the same task.<br/><br/>Just matter, switching energy of one sort or another.<br/><br/>Switches. Memory. The random element that is chance and that is called choice: common denominators, all.<br/><br/>I say again; you is what you done. Dynamic (mis)behaviourism, that's my creed.<br/><br/>Gurgeh? His switches are working funny. He's thinking differently, acting uncharacteristically. He is a different person. He's seen the worst that meatgrinder of a city could provide, and he just took it personally, and took his revenge.<br/><br/>Now he's spaceborne again, head crammed full of Azad rules, his brain adapted and adapting to the swirling, switching patterns of that seductive, encompassing, feral set of rules and possibilities, and being carted through space towards the Empire's most creakily symbolic shrine: Echronedal; the place of the standing wave of flame; the Fire Planet.<br/><br/>But will our hero prevail? Can he possibly prevail? And what would constitute winning, anyway?<br/><br/>How much has the man still got to learn? What will he make of such knowledge? More to the point, what will it make of him?<br/><br/>Wait and see. It'll work itself out, in time.<br/><br/>Take it from there, maestro…<br/><br/></blockquote>",1

9798986482712,2024/05/13,autism non-fiction read,read,1,2,"What I Mean When I Say I'm Autistic is more of a personal diary made public rather than a memoir or a primer on Autism and suffers for it. I'm not sure it's something in-between either, I don't really know what it is. It's OK, I guess?<br/><br/>I didn't hate it but I didn't find it to be very interesting. Compared to <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781399806855"">The Autistic Experience by Joe James and Marie-Laure Del Vecchio</a>, Annie Kotowicz's What I Mean When I Say I'm Autistic lacks the breadth of experience to make it feel like it matters.<br/><br/>Annie Kotowicz's self-reflection and thoughts on her experience of being Autistic, although important to her and those around her, feel like a drop in the pond compared to the 80+ Autistic voices that were featured in The Autistic Experience.<br/><br/>I'm sure the text was a great writing exercise for Annie Kotowicz and I'd love to do something similar for myself. But I question how relevant it is for people other than Annie Kotowicz, her fairy tale boyfriend Jake (this man is either A. not real B. a one in a billion catch C. he kills kids and it's all a facade) or people close to Annie Kotowicz.<br/><br/>For a text that is so focused on one person's experience of being Autistic, I would have expected some more detail about that experience. I would love to know what it felt like to be Annie Kotowicz in those moments where her being Autistic led to real conflict so that I could connect to her on a deeper level.<br/><br/>Annie Kotowicz does talk about moments from her life like this but they're written in such a way that makes her and me as the reader feel so far removed from these events that they're very hard to relate to. It's really hard to relate to the list of behaviors, symptoms and coping mechanisms that the rest of the book can be reduced to at times.<br/><br/>What I Mean When I Say I'm Autistic also doesn't serve as more comprehensive primer on Autism that someone could read and be guided onto a path of self-discovery because of how specific the text is to Annie Kotowicz's experience (the section on Musicals for example, demonstrates this specificity quite well). If you're looking for a more general book on Autism, check out <a href=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781946824912"">Understanding Autism In Adults And Aging Adults by Theresa Regan</a>. I was hoping for Annie Kotowicz to provide me with a shorter, perhaps more compelling ""primer"" on autism, but I definitely didn't get that.<br/><br/>Long story short, I didn't like this text very much. I was expecting something else which I didn't get, so after reading it, I was left feeling a little confused. This is a shame because there are quite a few chapters that have concise, compelling and particularly poignant views on the Autistic experience that deserve to be in a better book.<br/><br/>I might be able to be convinced to read other work by Annie Kotowicz but this book really didn't do it for me.",1
