I like Stories Of Your Life And Others quite a bit. Like with any short story collection, some stories will be better than others. My favorites are Story of Your Life (fantastic premise and <spoiler>twist</spoiler>), Understand (<spoiler>awesome escalation of stakes throughout the story</spoiler>), Hell Is the Absence of God (<spoiler>at this point I was becoming irrationally frustrated with Ted Chiang's fixation with God BUT this story's portrayal of God got me good</spoiler>) and Liking What You See: A Documentary (<spoiler>considering that this was written in 2002, I'm surprised how prophetic and relevant this story still is</spoiler>).<br/><br/>Here's my ratings for each story with a .gif to represent something in the story and/or my reaction to it.<br/><br/>Tower of Babylon ⭐⭐⭐<br/><spoiler><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/droptheball.gif"" width=""200"" height=""200"" /><br/></spoiler><br/>Understand ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br/><spoiler><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/explain.gif"" width=""200"" height=""127"" /><br/></spoiler><br/>Division by Zero ⭐⭐⭐<br/><spoiler><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/dunno.gif"" width=""200"" height=""200"" /><br/></spoiler><br/>Story of Your Life ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br/><spoiler><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/cheese.gif"" width=""200"" height=""200"" /><br/></spoiler><br/>Seventy-Two Letters ⭐⭐⭐<br/><spoiler><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/selfsabotage.gif"" width=""200"" height=""100"" /><br/></spoiler><br/>The Evolution of Human Science ⭐⭐⭐<br/><spoiler><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/thinking.gif"" width=""200"" height=""100"" /><br/></spoiler><br/>Hell Is the Absence of God ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br/><spoiler><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/scared.gif"" width=""200"" height=""138"" /><br/></spoiler><br/>Liking What You See: A Documentary ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br/><spoiler><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/img/react/heythere.gif"" width=""200"" height=""112"" /><br/></spoiler><br/>I remain unconvinced that the short story collection is a kind of book that I enjoy reading generally. It feels more like a way for publishers to sell short stories (which are probably a tough sell these days) than a format that deserves to exist outside of that context. If you've got any recommendations of short story collections that are better than the sum of their parts, send them my way!",1
