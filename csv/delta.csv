Nobody is to blame, the system is just like that and it'll never change.<br/><br/>Blah blah blah motorcycles blah blah.<br/><br/>Revolutions are pointless, the overthrown status quo will return as it once was because the status quo is deeply hierarchical, systemic and eternal. <br/><br/>Blah blah motorcycles blah blah blah.<br/><br/>The concentration of horrible politics expressed in this book defies comprehension. Tearing it apart in the margins for the first 100 pages or so made the reading feel less like the torture that it was. But in the end, that was just about how much I could stomach.",0

9781569711729,2025/09/03,3star comics read,read,1,3,"Dirty Pair is:<br/>- The eponymous pair, Kei and Yuri, of bio-engineered ""trouble consultants"" sent all over the universe to deal with ""trouble""---often achieving their goals with a blatant disregard for the ""collateral damage"" they cause.<br/>- An American comic serialized between 1988 and 2002 based on a Japanese light novel series. It's a raunchy science fiction action comedy with a healthy dose of cyberpunk esthetics spliced into it. - Not to be confused with <i>The Great Adventures of the Dirty Pair</i> manga from 2010-2011 by Hisao Tamaki. I don't know much about this adaptation other than the character designs being a little bland.<br/>- A decades long-running comic with a visual style that's changed so much (getting much worse rather than better) despite being drawn by the same artist throughout its entire run.<br/>- A heavily episodic comic that takes a little while to ""get good"". You might want to start reading at <i>A Plague of Angels</i>.<br/>- <a href=""https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2023/10/essay-adam-warrens-the-dirty-pair-is-a-forgotten-sci-fi-classic/"">Well-loved by its fans</a><br/>- Post-modern. Warren is well-aware of what the Dirty Pair comic is. Especially starting from <i>A Plague of Angels</i> onwards, Adam Warren seems to become more interested in putting textual commentary into the text itself. - In <i>A Plague of Angels</i>, the journalist Cory is introduced to the story (she's cannonically trans which is cool) and is tasked with following the Dirty Pair on one of their missions. Through Cory, Warren explicitly frames the Dirty Pair as being the whirlwind of chaos and destruction that they are (whereas prior to Cory's introduction, this theme of the show was mostly implicit). - In <i>Fatal and not Serious</i>, Cory is re-introduced to the story as a talk show host interviewing the Dirty Pair in the days before the inaugural Kei n' Yuri con 41, an in-universe fandom convention dedicated to the main characters of the comic book. An in-universe pair of AI hosts cover the events of the con live through personalized video streams to convention goers. In the comic, panels of commentary are spliced into the events of the comic providing color commentary, textual analysis and serve as another lens through which to view the Dirty Pair's shenaningans---all within the comic itself.<br/>- A little uneven. The first few arcs are really big standard, lacking the oomhph that makes the rest of the series stand out, and the last arc's art style is bad and just isn't that interesting.",1

In the end, I'd much rather a writer try something different, bold and fail to live up to the potential of their attempt instead of them writing something rote, expected and boring (which is thankfully not the case here).<br/><br/>Both the manga and anime are quite tame and not horny, despite what the premise and medium might lead you to believe. The potentially scandelous premise is leveraged to both entertain and help the viewer/reader empathise with these girls as they each, together and alone, come face to face with obstacles relating to their sexualities.",1

9781975310042,2025/09/05,4star comics read,read,1,4,"Silver Spoon is:<br/>- A manga by Hiromu Arakawa (known for her work on Full Metal Alchemist) which is an absolute masterclass in writing/drawing manga that goes way beyond providing you with a drip-feed of cheap thrills meant for children.<br/>- A big tear jerker but in a genuine way. There's very little melodrama. The drawings are used masterfully in combination with the words on the page to bring the characters's thoughts and emotions to life. <br/>- Thematically: - about meaning and purpose---the struggle to find it in your life. - about trauma---recognizing its lasting impact on your thoughts and your behaviour. - about community---leaning on it when you need to and contributing to it for the good of everyone. - about privilege---not taking it for granted and leveraging it to help make the world a better place.<br/>- Filled with Buddhist themes.<br/>- A manga serialized from April 2011 to November 2019. Over the course of 8 years, it shouldn't be surprising that the manga itself changed as the people making it changed and the world changed around them. - Serialization will always come at the expense of consistency (style, thematic cohesiveness, etc)---the degree to which this impacts a serialized work like this is something I'm always looking at. - There's great moments all throughout Silver Spoon but they're much more densely packed in the first half of the series. - There's a moment about halfway through the series where it feels like Arakawa ran out of good ideas, was unable to start closing loops (letting the guy and girl get together, and so on) and so, started padding out arcs without imbuing them with the love and care that was packed into the series up until this point. - In July 2013, Arakawa began working on the manga adaptation of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heroic_Legend_of_Arslan"">The Heroic Legend of Arslan</a>. Being responsible for two different serialized manga productions at the same time might have contributed to this drop in quality in Silver Spoon about halfway through its run.<br/><br/>Here's a few cool pages/panels from the first two volumes (nothing too spoilery):<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781975310042/1.png"" width=""200"" height=""84"" /><br/><br/>_Arakawa filling a single panel with Hachiken's thinking about three other characters, his verbal and non-verbal reactions to these thoughts and Mikage's reaction to his reaction.

Also, contrasting Aikawa, the squeamish veteranian hopeful, with the rest of the students here is a nice touch._<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781975310042/3.png"" width=""200"" height=""352"" /><br/><br/>_Arakawa cutting back-and-forth between the boys and the girls as each of them compete in a friendly (or not so friendly) physical competition._<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781975310042/4.png"" width=""200"" height=""287"" /><br/><br/>_Arakawa's amazing use of a black gradient escaping from the panels onto the page itself---representing Hachiken being overwhelmed by the trauma from his past._",1

I learned quite a bit about Canadian politics.<br/>- No Quebec government has ever signed the Canadian Constitution. Quebec's government and its people are still beholden to the constitution despite none of us ever having signed it...<br/>- The maximum prison sentence in Canada/Quebec is two years minus one day. This makes a lot of sense because sentences longer than that don't dissuade people from committing crimes and thus they are purely punitive.<br/>- The Canadian Constition has a clause that ensures the federal government retains all power over any new ""domains"" that might come up later down the line (think airports). It's an ""interesting"" way of retaining power over the unknown/future.<br/>- In any election, at any level (federal, provicincial, municipal), you are voting for candidates rather than the parties they may or may not be affliated with. And so, once elected, a person can choose to change their party affliation, or even become independent. Now, this doesn't happen often because it is likely to make the people who've voted for you pissed but it can and does happen.<br/>- Although the exploitation of natural resources belongs to the provinces, the federal government could step in and take over if they chose to do so. For example, they step in when building oil pipelines across provincial borders. And, the federal government could technically take over Hydro-Quebec under the right circumstances (TBD).<br/>- The complex Venn diagrams of issues that are tackled by the federal government only and the provincial government only, and issues that belong to both (with the provincial governments delegating what they choose to, to the municipal level).",1
