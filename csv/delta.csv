Fables is explicitly an allegory for the Isreal-Palestinian conflict. So I'm expecting more than a little yikes with a dash of Islamophobia in this comic book so let's see how far we get.<br/><br/>1 volume into it so far and I'm curious to see what happens next. It's nice to read through a comic book that, so far, is much more compressed than the Berserk manga I just finished. We're not luxuriating in chapter after chapter of every single movement a guy makes as he's slicing through a horde of demons. Instead, in Fables, and American comics more broadly, we zoom in on interesting scenes and skip over the details.<br/><br/>There's a place for both compressed and decompressed art depicting moments in time like comic books and manga. But after reading through 41 volumes of hyper decompressed manga, I need a break!",1

The art styles of each short comic are varied as you can imagine, and some are surprisingly good.<br/><br/>In the foreword, Jodorowsky explains a bit about his process. He says that he tries to tell stories that fit with the artists's strengths and interests. He says says that he's been going this his entire career. For example, John Difool from the Incal has a bit of Moebius in him.",1

I'm into it.<br/><br/>The writing is odd. The choice to retain poetic-sounding language with rhymes is a bold one because speech bubbles and their placement prevents the reader from being able to read the lines in the precise manner required to fully appreciate the alliteration and the rhymes of the poetry.<br/><br/>The art is fantastic, it's psychedelic, wavy and colourful. It provides a solid lens through which to really see this sci-fi universe for what it is: one that is malleable, in flux and always being altered by the whims of the Olympian Gods.<br/><spoiler><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/books/9781632159274/p10.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""307"" /><br/></spoiler><br/>The choice to interweave the Epic of Gilgamesh into the story as well is kind of wild. Especially framing the story as read by He, the gimp (Helen?) of Odysseus.",1

The extremely taboo and fucked up premise for this is one thing, but I'll read a story about anything. It's just so bad.<br/><br/>I cannot begin to imagine what sort of circumstances would have led to the production of this comic. That's what I'd like to know.s",1
