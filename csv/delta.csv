The people must learn how well I govern them. How would they know if we didn't tell them?""</blockquote><br/><br/>It's Dune. It's aged surprisingly well. It has a lot to say about the world of today on the verge of collapse due to the destruction of our climate, poorly thought through technology, rampant late capitalism and the ever enticing venus flytrap of ideology.<br/><br/>Having watched both David Lynch's Dune and Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part One, I feel like although both are interesting and good in their own way (yes, even the David Lynch movie), Dune is a story best told as a novel, by adapting Dune into a movie you lose a lot of what makes Dune interesting.<br/><br/>Maybe if Jodorowsky had been able to achieve his vision of a 15 hour long movie adaptation of Dune, I'd feel differently... but here we are.<br/><br/>What makes Frank Herbert's Dune novel so special for me? Well, it's a few things. The concerns present in the text (environmental, technological, late capitalism-related, ideological) have only become more relevant in the decades since the novel was written.<br/><br/>The novel is by no means perfect and one could argue that Denis Villeneuve's movie is a better and more cohesive ""product"" compared to the novel. But Denis Villeneuve's movie suffers from being a big budget movie that has to condense and drop many of the more interesting parts of the novel and whitewash or completely remove the novel's more subversive ideas.<br/><br/>Another part of the novel that I enjoy quite a bit which isn't present in the movies is Frank Herbert's mastery of the shifting POV. Multiple POV characters is not anything new to me, almost every single novel I read has multiple POV characters. Dune is different because it has an omniscient narrator that dives deep into the psyche of each of the characters it's focusing on, showing the reader their inner thoughts and concerns while also smoothly flowing from one character to the next within the same chapter, even the same paragraph.<br/><br/><blockquote>One thought remained to him. [POV Character ||| 1] saw it in formless light on rays of black: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain. |||<br/>Silence.<br/><br/>[POV Character ||| 2] stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole behind the table. He had slammed it on a room full of dead men. His senses took in guards swarming around him. Did I breathe it? he asked himself. |||<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm not too surprised why this is rarely done today. It must be hard to do well and even when done well it's much harder for the reader to follow. It seems as though a lot of readers today, perhaps this has always been true, skim through the texts they read. You can't skim through a text like Dune and expect to understand what's going on at all times because of the constantly switching focus of the omniscient narrator.<br/><br/>Are there any problems with Frank Herbert's Dune? Absolutely. The one issue that stands out to me is the introduction of Feyd-Rautha in the last quarter of the book. Unlike every other character in the novel who is introduced early on and built upon throughout the text, Feyd-Rautha shows up out of nowhere and we're expected to care about his bullshit.<br/><br/>I wonder if this discrepancy comes from Dune's initial publication as a two-part serial? I don't know but it doesn't work for me. Feyd-Rautha should have been introduced way earlier which would have given the reader more time to build the character up in their minds before the final confrontation with him at the end of the novel.<br/><br/>I'm in love with Dune and I'm committed to reading through its sequel Dune Messiah next. If I enjoy that, I'll likely be taking a look at Children of Dune sooner than later.<br/><br/>PS: Special mention to Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son. Reading through Brian's afterword to Dune and his foreword to the sequel Dune Messiah brought me a lot of joy because of how childish, clownish and delusional Brian Herbert seems to be.<br/><br/><blockquote>As if whispering in his own ear, Frank Herbert constantly reminded himself that he was mortal. If he had been a politician, he would have undoubtedly been an honorable one, perhaps even one of our greatest U.S. presidents.</blockquote><br/><br/>Also, Brian Herbert is clearly someone who does not understand what made his father's work resonate so widely and the fact that the ""Dune"" torch was passed down to him is truly sad. What a clown hehe.",1

Grunts is a satire of the schlocky high fantasy Tolkien ripoffs of the 70s and 80s. It pokes fun at the aesthetic of the American military as portrayed in film and literature. It combines Grand Guignol (think slapstick but extra gory and violent) dark comedy with satire on bad fantasy.<br/><br/>The story begins with a group of orcs, the Agaku led by the orc Ashnak, tasked with stealing powerful yet non-magical weapons from a dragon's hoard by the nameless necromancer. The pretense for this quest is that these weapons will be useful for the Final Battle between the forces of Light and Dark that's about to happen.<br/><br/>These weapons turn out to be an impressive assortment of modern military equipment: assault rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, tanks, helicopters, surface to air missile launchers...<br/><br/>You name it, they've got it.<br/><br/>The Agaku are your stereotypical generic fantasy orcs: a little stupid, violent, strong. The dragon's hoard of modern military weaponry was cursed with a geas which changes the mindset of the orcs into the stereotypical Vietnam War United States Marine Corps soldier mindset: huuuuuurrah-ing, tabbaco chewing, cigar smoking, a belief that might makes right, etc.<br/><br/>Hijinks ensue.<br/><br/><b>Minor Spoilers Ahead</b><br/><br/>It turns out that the modern military equipment the orc marines have access to isn't enough to turn the tide of the Final Battle. The forces of Light win but many of the forces of Dark, including Ashnak and his orc marines, manage to escape. The orc marines return to their fort in Nin-Edin.<br/><br/>In the following weeks, the forces of Light chase down and ethnically cleanse (we'll get into it) the remaining forces of Dark. This leads to a siege (take a shot every time Mary Gentle depicts a siege in her work) where Ashnak and his orc marines have dug into their fort at Nin-Edin and are preparing to fend off the forces of Light.<br/><br/>Note that all this happens in the first third of the novel, subverting the trope of the not so final Final Battle.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Let's talk about the forces of Light. Epic fantasy has always had a problematic relationship with presenting good/bad in black and white terms with little room in between. My understanding is that this simplicity appeals to the human desire to constantly simplify the eternally complex real world in order to live within it.<br/><br/>That's fine. But by presenting good/bad like this, it's easy to fall into the trap (intentionally or not) of depicting certain beings as inherently evil. <br/><br/>Dehumanizing the human.<br/><br/>Mary Gentle portrays the forces of Light and Dark....<br/><br/>posits that the weapons we have access to change us (power corrupts), she posits that power is power and war is war,<br/><br/>... fantasy satire with grit. Think Terry Pratchett but more mature and with a lot more gore and violence.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>themes to explore: ethnic cleansing, rnd orc with gold eyes (1/8th elven)<br/><br/>Kicking off the book with the ""nameless necromancer"" completely wasted on wine, sending off one of his orc captains on a quest of some sort was a great way to start.<br/><br/>I think this is going to be a goldmine for fantasy roleplaying ideas...<br/><br/><blockquote> ""Ned and Will Brandiman,"" Ned introduced. ""Notorious 'alflings. Sir and madam, you are looking at two of the greatest professionals it will ever be your good fortune to meet. As to what we do, we find lost property.""<br/><br/>Shazgurim snorted. ""And is it usually lost before you two 'find' it?""<br/><br/>""Now that you come to mention itâ€¦""<br/><br/>Ashnak nodded his great tusked head. ""Thieves. Our master the nameless said there would be thieves.""<br/><br/>""We prefer the term adventurers. It sounds so much more respectable."" Will brushed himself down and strolled across the dip to look at the ransacked chests. ""You realise it will be necessary to return the tools of our trade? And, now I come to think about it, we have no transport. I think it would probably be advisable for you to detail one of your warriors to carry these chests for us."" </blockquote>",1
