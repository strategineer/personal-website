blurb: Stat Tracking for Artifact, the competitive card game.

Artifact Stat Tracker was developed using python and Google Sheets.

As I played the game, I entered data into the Google Sheets document using custom built UIs, the python script would then read the data within the Google Sheets document, manipulate it and inject it, with more contextual information, back into the Google Sheets document.

The Google Sheets document would then use the given data produce tables and charts with interesting insights to help improve my play on a competitive level such as:

- A "succinct" description of each deck used displaying the hero cards and the most important cards based on their tier.
- Win rates per card which could be used for better understanding each card's power/value.
- A running total of the real money profit made from playing the game on a weekly, monthly, yearly basis, etc.).
