pros:
    - "Encourages offense rather than defense (unlike SF4)."
    - "Gigantic roster of thirty plus interesting characters."
    - "Plays well with a controller (Fighting stick not needed)."
    - "Simple inputs for special moves (quarter circle motion, shoryuken motion, or back-forward motion)."
    - "Combo assist and combo breakers make for interesting and cool looking fights even at low level play."
    - "Shadow AI system is insanely fun, as you play your shadow learns to play like you and then you or other players can fight against it."
    - "Award winning sound design (it's so good that a blind player can compete at a high level in the game)."
cons:
    - "Some humanoid characters look quite dated but others look great."
