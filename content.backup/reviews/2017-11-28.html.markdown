pros:
    - "Mimicks real world mini putt but with crazier holes than you can find in real life."
    - "Swinging your putter by moving your mouse back and thrusting it forward is great."
    - "Tons of custom maps due to the powerful level editor and the active community."
    - "Simultaneous play and collisions between balls makes for a fun time with friends."
cons:
    - "Not able to reconnect to a match in progress if you're disconnected due to connection issues."
    - "Level editor is powerful but lacks a couple of essential features (like Undo/Redo functionality)."
