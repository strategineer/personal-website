pros:
    - "Gameplay mechanics are fun and well designed (honed to perfection from Pillars of Destiny?)."
    - "The setting of Tyranny is unique and fun to play in (perhaps due to how your decisions impact the world in a meaningful way)."
    - "Companions are interesting and each has their own unique abilities and skill tree (no generic classes)."
    - "Choices you make are meaningful and have a big impact on the story, your place within it and what you'll experience in the game."
    - "Magic system consisting of combining various sigils to produce custom spells is interesting and fun to experiment with."
cons:
    - "Voice acting is so good that it hurts you a little bit when a character loses their voice in middle of a dialogue."
outro: "If you enjoy CRPGs, especially if you've enjoyed more modern RPGs such as Pillars of Destiny, then you can hardly go wrong with Tyranny."

Tyranny is a modern CRPG by Obsidian Entertainment with tight gameplay mechanics and an intriguing world.
