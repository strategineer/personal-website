pros:
    - "Each of the eight different androids, which you unlock as you progress through the game, plays quite differently from one another which provides a lot of variety and replayability."
    - "The core gameplay loop is simple but it works really well. It consists of shooting enemies, picking up powerups, avoid/dodging enemies, shooting with your secondary more powerful weapon and doing it over and over again against a wide variety of different enemies and bosses. There's never a dull moment, it's action action and even more action."
    - "Great with friends. I wasn't expecting much from the game but I played it with a friend. To be honest, we had a hard time putting the game down, we were having a lot of fun and we were laughing so much."
    - "The overall tone of the game set primarily by the art, the environments, the story, the voice acting and the soundtrack is hard to explain but it's unique and unlike anything I've seen in the past."
    - "The soundtrack is amazing. All the songs are really well put together and fit the game perfectly. When one song in particular called Little Android started playing I was laughing so hard that it forced me to get up and take a piss because I was going to piss in my pants, however while pissing I was laughing even harder and it almost made me shit my pants. Truly a great work of art."
