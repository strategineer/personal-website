In Pyre, you play the role of the Reader, an exile who's tasked with leading a group of fellow exiles called the Nightwings through sports-like rituals called the Rites.

Pyre is an RPG with real-time sports-like battles with fun gameplay, beautiful art, a wonderful soundtrack and a world that's easy to become lost in.
