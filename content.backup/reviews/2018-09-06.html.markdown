pros:
    - "Story has gut wrenching moments but also sprinkling funny adventures and dialogs for a good balance."
    - "Systems working in unison to encourage role play such as the sleep-to-save system, the fast travel that takes time but goes by quicker if you have a better horse, the methodical leveling that can be sped up through training with others or by reading skills books after learning to read, etc."
    - "Using a Elder Scrolls like system, the leveling feels good due to abundance of trainers and perks to choose from."
    - "Unlike Elders Scrolls games, the combat in KCD feels great."
cons:
    - "Game is long (30-100h)"
    - "Even though being a sneaky thief feels good, pickpocketting is probably too easy."
    - "Some jank like AI combat issues, clothes clipping in every way possible, characters shouting nonsense at the wrong time."
outro: "If you're a history buff, open-world RPG fan or someone interested in playing an open-world RPG with basic combat systems that actually work then you can't go wrong with Kingdom Come Deliverance."

In Kingdom Come Deliverance, you play as Henry, the son of a blacksmith, in the late medieval era as he branches off on his own for adventure and possibly revenge.

Kingdom Come Deliverance is a historical open-world RPG taking place in the Holy Roman Empire in the 15th century with gameplay systems reminiscent of the Elder Scrolls games with a world that feels more alive but smaller with fun gameplay systems including combat, archery/hunting, etc.)
