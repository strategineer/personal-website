pros:
    - "Art style is intriguing but just don't look at the hands."
cons:
    - "Horrible writing."
    - "Horrible VO."
    - "Horrible music."
    - "Moon logic garbage &quot;puzzles&quot; (at least the first &quot;puzzle&quot; before I uninstalled)."
outro: "If you're dead inside and/or are a fan of archaic graphic adventure games that ask you to solve &quot;puzzles&quot; for no reason then you might be interested in Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today."

In Dead Synchronicity Tomorrow Comes Today, you play as an amnesiac named Michael, the world has hit by some kind of mysterious calamity.

Dead Synchronicity Tomorrow Comes Today is a graphic adventure game, it's pretty shit.
