Mages of Mystralia was just given away for free on the Epic Games store a few days ago. And it's made me retread the past a little, thinking about what could have been and what actually was.

Fresh out of university, I took a gigantic pay cut (never do that kids) to work in the video game industry, because I had always dreamed of making games. I'd been participating in game jams and making my own games in my free time for years, and so I thought that getting paid to work in games professionally was the next logical step for me.

If I could go back in time and stop myself, I would. After spending a year and a half working on someone's else game that is so profoundly mediocre really killed any kind of passion I had for making my own games.

And, I haven't tried making games ever since.

After working on Mages of Mystralia for Borealys Games (and a cancelled project), I started working in the newly formed (and now defunct) VR division of Framestore, a special effects company. I worked on tools and everything other than the actual games themselves.

I was tossed from the pan straight into the flames (if you can believe it). A few months after starting my new job, I began experiencing severe chronic pain in my wrists and I fell into a pit of despair because of it. It was hard to do my job at a time when my wrists were in constant pain. That combined with horrible management and a HR department from hell started to make me lose my mind.

As one usually does, I burned out. I was convinced to quit instead of going on unemployment by my boss (a real class act that guy was).

You can imagine what that kind of experience does to someone. Unfortunately, I don't need to.

Thinking about making games made me sick to my stomach for a long time.

And I'm not sure I'm over it.

Now, I'm working in an industry that I'm not passionate about and I'm much happier. I solve my technical problems and at the end of the day I don't need to feel the existential dread of having worked on someone else's (bankrupt creative) vision.

Instead, I write shit on here.

And that's what I've chosen to do with my life.
