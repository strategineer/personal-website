The Odyssey is a power fantasy.

Odysseus is presented as a "victim", he's far from home and since he's been gone, more than a hundred men have been spending his wealth and coveting his wife. He finally comes back home and brutally murders all of them, including any female slaves who dared to sleep with any of them.

He's presented as a victim and a hero but I can't help but feel like he's actually a villain. Here's a few reasons why:

- Odysseus is so rich that a hundred men can be doing everything they can to spend all his cash over decades and he's still super rich by the time he comes back and murders them all.
- Odysseus's actions lead to every single member of his crew dying, usually horribly. Yes, Athena and Poseidon punish the Greeks on their way home, including Odysseus, because they chose to do nothing when Cassandra tried to claim sanctuary in the temple of Athena at Troy during the sacking of the city, and Ajax the Lesser dragged her away and raped her. Even so, on more than one occasion he knowingly sends his crew off to die (Scylla and Charybdis) in his quest to get back home no matter the cost.

Does Odysseus have free will? Clearly, otherwise why would the gods be mad at him in the first place. But, the mortal world is a playground that the gods play in. Athena curses Odysseus and actively makes it harder for him to get back home but without her help he would have never been able to get back (and kill everyone).

The Greek gods are fickle, powerful and unknowable because that's what the world was like back then. We didn't understand much about the world and the way it worked.

Even now, think about COVID. Who could have predicted a virus killing infecting this many people, killing quite a few and keeping us all stuck inside?

Well it's not reall 100% the virus that kept us stuck inside but it didn't help.

Separate we are weak, together we are strong. The status quo remains as long as stay separate, fighting our own fights. We won't defeat the rich and force them to spread their wealth if we're alone.

Be a suitor. The suitors are the heroes of the story taking the wealth away from an uber rich murderer. Them coveting Penelope is a little sketch because she clearly wants none of them. But hey...


Athena, and the rest of the gods, seem to be the first Drama Queens.
