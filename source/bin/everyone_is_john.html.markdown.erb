The GM reveals John's tagline to players.

The PCs talk through and create their Voices' skills (GM must approve all skills), adding them to the spreadsheet.

  - Choose two specific skills, gain 10 Willpower
  - Choose three, gain 7 Willpower
  - For maximum fun, don't pick skills that are similar to skills that other players have

/set skills skill1: Drinking excessive amounts of Pilk skill2: Making Pilk
or
/set skills skill1: Drinking excessive amounts of Pilk skill2: Making Pilk skill3: Quick Reflexes
~~~

The PCs run the command below to set their Level 1, 2 and 3 Obsessions (Each PC must secretly send their obsessions to the GM for approval beforehand, some private back-and-forth may occur to make them just right).
  - Obsessions are the insane (and sometimes nonsensical) drives of each Voice. Completing them rewards points.
  - Each level of obsession should be progressively harder to achieve.
  - Each should be relatively simple and written in a short sentence.

~~~
/set obsessions obsession1: Drink Pilk obsession2: Get somebody else to drink Pilk obsession3: Drink Pilk made from fresh milk you've milked from a cow yourself

Play begins.

# How to Play

## Willpower
- Each Voice starts with 10 (or 7 if they've chosen three skills) willpower
- Voices spend willpower in two ways:
  - In [Tests for Control](#tests-for-control), to assert their dominance and take control of John.
  - To improve the chances of their [Skill Checks](#skill-checks) succeeding

~~~
/view willpower
~~~

## Skill Checks
- Roll a six-sided die:
  - Succeed on a 3 or better for skills you have
  - Succeed on a 6 for skills you don't have
- Before the roll, you can spend Willpower to add a +1 to the result

## Tests for Control
Tests for control occur when:

- John wakes up. (Yesâ€¦ this also means at the start of the session.)
- John is injured.
- Any Obsession is completed.
- Any Check is failed.
- John Gets Distracted and Falls Asleep (pg. 19).

Each Voice runs the following command with their bid in Willpower points

~~~
/set bid 7
~~~

The Voice with the highest bid takes control of John. If multiple Voices tie for the highest bid, then dice are rolled to see who becomes the active Voice.

The Voice who becomes active loses the amount of Willpower they bid. All
others keep their bids.
