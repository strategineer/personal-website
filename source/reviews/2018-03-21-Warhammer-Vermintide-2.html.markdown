tags: PC, thumbs_up
pros:
    - "Amazing gameplay from the first game returns with many additions making this a must have coop experience."
    - "Enormous amounts of new content (60+ weapons, bosses, minibosses, specials and an entire new faction to fight against)."
    - "Five different heroes from the first game return with 15 different backstories/subclasses that make them unique to play."
    - "Thirteen maps, larger in scope than the ones in the first game, with many more to come (no small maps!)."
    - "Heroic deeds (missions with random mutators and extra rewards) add a lot of potential for fun."
cons:
    - "Illusion of choice with regards to talent trees, also applies to weapons and stats (choose between two horrible literally the worst thing possible and a good choice)."
outro: "Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is an instabuy for people who enjoyed the first game, for anyone who enjoyed playing L4D with friends or anyone who's interested in the Warhammer universe."

Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is a masterful evolution of the L4D legacy set within the Warhammer universe.
