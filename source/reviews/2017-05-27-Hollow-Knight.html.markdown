Hollow Knight is a great Metroidvania game with a pinch of Souls-like elements sprinkled in.

## Pros

- Exploring the beautiful, interesting and varied levels is enjoyable.
- Looking for and finding collectables is intrinsically fun because they are always useful.
- Equipping charms, items that grant passive abilities, allow you to customize your experience and allow you to optimize your "build" for different situations.
- Fighting bosses, of which there are many, is a real challenge and quite rewarding once you beat them.
- Gaining abilities, most of which change the way you play traverse, fight and play the game is gratifying.
- Learning about the world and the overarching story is intriguing because it is well thought-out but cryptic and mysterious (reminds me a lot of Dark Souls).

## Cons

- Backtracking through the same areas multiple times may become a chore for some.
- Dying against bosses will happen sometimes but you'll rarely die from normal enemies or environmental hazards.
