If you're reading this, it's because you've been invited to my hyper ultra exclusive VIP weekly movie screenings.

Come with whoever you want. RSVP (by phone, by text message or by email at <me@strategineer.com>) a little bit ahead of time if you can. If you want to bring beer or snacks, feel free but don't feel obligated to.

After the past year or two we've had, I can't be the only one wanting to talk with old friends (maybe see some new faces) while watching interesting movies sitting on the same couch ;0

I hope to see you sometime!

### Thoughts

Mandy: I went in expecting a comedy but nothing was funny? Nicholas Cage is doing a real bad job here. The first 45min were interesting and then it became mediocre John Wick.

Johnny Mnemonic: Despite Keanu Reeves not knowing how to act and William Gibson being an overrated writer, this movie was fun to watch and I've been thinking about it ever since.
