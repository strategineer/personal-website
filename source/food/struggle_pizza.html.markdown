blurb: Take a cheap frozen pizza, that makes you reflect on your crippling depression caused by living in a world where megacorporations rule and people suffer, and turn it into a decent frozen pizza.
servings: 1
ingredients:
  - 1 store-bought thin crust frozen pizza (ideally with some meat on it)
  - 1 cup spinach (chopped)
  - 1 challot (diced)
  - 5 white mushrooms (sliced)
  - 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
steps:
  - Spread the challot, the mushroom slices and the spinach on top of the frozen pizza evenly, in that order.
  - Drizzle the olive oil on top of the pizza.
  - Follow the frozen pizza's instructions, watch the oven closely as it's cooking in case you need to take it out early or keep it in a little longer due to the extra toppings.
  - Remove from oven when the pizza is cooked through, cut into slices and serve.
