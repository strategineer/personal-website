Despite getting sucked into Hunt Showdown in a big way this year, I spent less time playing games than I usually do.

Still, I enjoyed [diving into other worlds with the Oculus Quest 2](/blog/2020-11-07/), [quick resuming games on my Xbox Series X](/blog/2021-03-21/) (purchased in desperation after years of wanting to upgrade my PC but not being able to due to shortages) and playing games on the freshly built monster PC I decided to buy anyway.

Here's a list of games that I enjoyed this year in no particular order.

### Supernatural (Oculus Quest 2)

![](./supernatural.jpg)

I've worked in the VR space, I've had 3 different headsets and I've played a lot of VR games. Maybe that adds to my credibility when I say that Supernatural is the best VR workout experience I've had.

Supernatural lets you dance and box to the rhythm of good music in a beautiful landscape with a trainer encouraging you along the way.

Workouts, new ones being published daily, vary in terms of intensity, duration and genre of music allowing you to spend exactly as much time as you have, working out as hard as you like accompanied by the kind of music you're into.

Supernatural isn't doing anything new, it's just doing it way better than any other VR fitness game out there.

You can spend a lot of time sifting through a sea of horrible Beat Saber custom maps and build a few playlists with good music and fitness focused movement that you can rotate through.

Or, you could just put on your headset and you're ready to go (if you're playing Supernatural).

What's the catch? Well, Supernatural is a subscription service. You pay them monthly because they need to pay the designers making the workouts, the trainers guiding you through the workouts and the record labels that Supernatural is licensing the good music from.

You might be wondering about the trainers... I like working out alone, usually. But having a trainer encouraging me during my Supernatural workouts helps to keep me motivated to keep coming back.

The game is tricking me into thinking that there's someone out there, other than myself, who's invested in my health and personal well-being.

It feels a little weird but it works and I'm fitter than I've ever been. I can't complain.

### It Takes Two (Xbox Series X)
![](./it_takes_two.jpg)

It Takes Two surprised me by being:

- The best 3D platformer I've ever played.
- A uniquely cooperative experience that can be played locally.
- Challenging enough to keep me invested but accessible enough for my coop partner to not be overwhelmed.

I jump at any chance I get to play a game with another person sitting next to me. I've always enjoyed sharing my passion for games with others and there's no better way of doing that than by playing a game with someone else.

There's very few local cooperatives games being made anymore. We're lucky that one as good as It Takes Two was made.

And, I'm very happy to have experienced it with someone I care about.

### Heavenly Bodies (PC)

![](./heavenly_bodies.jpg)

Heavenly Bodies is, also, a cooperative multiplayer game.

In Heavenly Bodies, you play as an astronaut in (you guessed it!) space. You, and a friend, are thrust into various missions where you have to do astronauty things like adjust solar panels, mine asteroids and repair satellites.

What makes this interesting is that you can't control your character directly, but you do have some limited control over their "Heavenly Body".

You use each analog stick to move your astronaut's arms around, you use the triggers to grab onto walls or hold onto objects and you can use the bumpers to bend your knees closer to your body.

That's it.

Remember you're in space, there's no friction. So you if you start gaining momentum in a certain direction, you're going to keep moving in that direction unless you grab onto something. At least that's the case when playing on the Newtonian difficulty, other difficulty options make things less "realistic" but more accessible.

Controlling your astronaut is difficult but as you play, you gradually gain more familiarity with the initially awkward control scheme and eventually it becomes second nature.

Each mission requires you to complete increasingly challenging tasks encouraging you to gain mastery over the way you control your astronaut. I've never played Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy but Heavenly Bodies definitely shares some DNA with it.

There's a beauty in a game like this that gradually reveals itself to you. I love easy to learn yet hard to master games like this.

The music is very "spacey" and meditative. Sometimes you just let go of whatever you're holding onto and float. Immersing yourself in the atmosphere, or lack of it.


### Resident Evil 4 VR (Oculus Quest 2)

![](./resident_evil_4_vr.jpg)

Resident Evil 4 released on the GameCube on January 11th, 2005.

Why is a version of it appearing here?

Well VR is a game changer.

### Psychonauts 2 (PC)

### GarticPhone (PC)

You and your friends write sentences. Then everyone gets a sentence written by someone else and has to draw whatever that sentence is describing. Then everyone gets a drawing and has to write a sentence that describes the drawing they're given.

This continues until everyone has participated in each album of sentences/drawings.

Finally, everyone looks at each of the albums together and then you'll all laugh harder then you've ever laughed in your entire lives.

### DUSK (PC)

![](./dusk.jpg)

Dusk feels like a gateway drug into the world of boomer shooters. The vibes and gameplay might have worked especially well on me because I have a lot of nostalgia for playing Doom when I was a kid but I think that many parts of the game would stand out even for people without nostalgia for the genre.

It is a "video game ass video game". You run and jump around environments shooting "demons" (?), finding secret ammo caches along the way so you can keep firing your favorite weapons.

Taken at face value, maybe that doesn't sound very interesting? But the core gameplay loop really does feel great.

What adds to it and makes the whole experience worthwhile is the level design that takes you on a journey through a wide variety of environments filled with enemies. These levels force you to use all the tools at your disposal to survive. They are functionally and visually different from one another and that serves to keep you moving forward through the game and keeps things interesting.

### Guilty Gear Strive (PC)

![](./guilty_gear_strive.jpg)

A dayum good fighting game, and the only one I've gotten "seriously" into in my entire life. I've stopped playing it because:

1. Their online code is brittle (actually playing the game against other players feels great but getting there is a challenge and takes way more time than it needs to).
2. They seemed to have done little to try and improve the situation in the months since the game came out.
3. Even using a Hitbox, it's still pretty painful for me to play fighting games. I don't necessarily feel it right away, but a day later, my hands are wrecked.

I like the idea of playing fighting games more than I do actually playing them.

### Slipways (PC)

![](./slipways.jpg)

Slipways is a puzzle strategy (more puzzle than strategy) game where you are placed in a randomly generated sector of the galaxy and are tasked with creating colonies and connecting them through their imports and exports. It sounds easy but it's not.

Each kind of planetary body has a few different options available to you, each of which requires and exports a different set of products. If you're into other logistics-heavy games like Factorio or shapez.io, then you might be into the logistics-focused puzzle experience offered by Slipways.

### Hunt Showdown (PC)
![](./hunt_showdown.jpg)

I played 200h hours of Hunt Showdown this year. The gift that keeps on giving. Described like a drug by many, it contains more Skinner boxes than I've ever seen in a video game.

I tell myself that I keep coming back for the deep, strategic action gameplay but maybe, me and everyone I play with are incredibly addicted to the rewards, or lack there of, we receive whenever we press a button.

I'm done with Hunt Showdown. Never again.
