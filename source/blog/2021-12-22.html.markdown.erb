I watched way more movies this year than I thought I did. Although, most of the movies I watched this year were very forgettable soooo that might explain why.

Here's a list of the movies I watched in 2021 in categories that describe how I felt about them (within each category, the ordering is irrelevant).

## Movies I loved

![](./johnny_mnemonic.jpg)

Johnny Mnemonic
: Keanu Reeves in a business suit going absolutely insane in a dystopian cyberpunk world. Keanu's inability to act and William Gibson's inability to write only added to the charm of this movie.
: It feels as though the pile of trash that Johnny stands on when making his speech about wanting "room service" near the end of the movie, represents the movie itself.
: I was able to use this pile of trash as a stepping stone to introspect on the disillusionment one can feel as a white-collar worker living in a capitalist dystopia.

![](./paddington.jpg)

Paddington
: Paddington is a fluffy bear who leaves the forest after tragedy strikes and goes to London to meet the explorer who taught his family to speak. Far from the place he used to call home, he tries desperately to fit in and surround himself with people who love him.
: We are all Paddington and his story is a story of hope that will bring you and your entire family to tears - of sadness but eventually of joy.

Bo Burnham: Inside
: A one man comedy-drama musical filmed and recorded in a single room during the COVID-19 pandemic. You'll laugh, you might cry, but you'll probably cry while you're laughing.
: Big shoutout to the Jeff Bezos Song, that one's a masterpiece.

![](./white_chicks.jpg)

White Chicks
: Has a movie about two black FBI agents dressing up as white women to solve a kidnapping plot aged well?
: Way more than you would expect.

Another Round (2020)
: Mads Mikkelsen and his coworkers, all high school teachers, drink during the day to keep their blood alcohol level at a certain level for "science".
: Hilarity and tragedy in equal amounts ensues.

![](./jennifers_body.jpg)

Jennifer's Body
: They did this movie real dirty with the way it was marketed.
: It's good AF.

![](./mission_impossible.jpg)

Mission Impossible
: Tom Cruise strikes again, he can do no wrong (on the screen). Prior to this year, I had never watched a Mission Impossible movie and I'm glad I finally corrected that.
: I haven't felt compelled to watch any of the other ones yet, but I will watch at least one more of these in 2022.

![](./rush_hour.jpg)

Rush Hour
: It hasn't aged very well but Jackie Chan makes any movie he's in amazing just by being in it.

## Movies I hated

![](./chaos_walking.jpg)

Chaos Walking
: Men being unable to hide their thoughts is one of the goofiest ideas I've ever seen in a movie.
: They could afford one scene with an alien and then the aliens are never mentioned again despite them being critical to the plot the whole way through?
: I have many questions but my most important one is: how did this get made?

![](./mandy.jpg)

Mandy
: Produced by our lord and saviour, Elijah Wood, Mandy is a psychedelic horror film directed by a Greek-Italian-Canadian director and starring Nicolas Cage...
: This movie is the definition of style over substance. After watching it, I would hesitate to call it a film, it's more like a series of nonsensical clips.
: Smoking copious amounts of the devil's lettuce might make this movie bearable to watch.
: Keyword: might.


## Great coming of age teen comedy films that I watched

![](./shes_the_man.jpg)

She's the Man
: Amanda Bynes was probably my first crush.
: In "She's the Man", her soccer team gets the ax, she asks if the girls can try out to join the boys team, the coach and her boyfriend (soon to be ex) laugh at her.
: She's not happy about this so she masquerades as her brother to play on the boys soccer team at his high school. Her goal is to eventually beat her ex's soccer team and show them that she can be just as good if not better than the boys.
: If you're nostalgic for Amanda Bynes doing a great job on the big screen, you've got to watch this. Even if Amanda Bynes never made your PP go bruh, you should probably still watch this.

![](./clueless.jpg)

Clueless
: Clueless is a classic and for good reason. It's good. That's the reason.

![](./debs.jpg)

DEBS
: This is an absolutely absurd movie about spies secretly being selected through SAT tests and a spy-in-training falling in love with a supervillain.
: It bombed at the box office hard, and I mean haaaaaaaaaard. It's not good but watching it was life changing.

![](./not_another_teen_movie.jpg)

Not Another Teen Movie
: I love absurd parody movies when they're done well. This is a great one of those.
