I've never experienced insomnia (well except when I was really sick AF or emotionally raw).

How? The Wall.

A white featureless wall that expands into infinity. it's as big as you can imagine. I focus on the wall and only the wall and eventually I fall alseep.

I don't do this every night, but when I'm having a hard time sleeping that's what I do.

It can't be something that's super unique. Counting sheep. Wheel of time: focusing on the flame and the void.
