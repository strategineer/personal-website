I feel like my productivity gets boosted substantially if I'm listening to the right kind of music music?

Or maybe [listening to good music makes me happy (and more productive)?](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200317-does-music-help-us-work-it-depends).

Or maybe I decide to listen to music when I'm happy and I'm already being more productive than usual because I'm happy?

I don't know.
