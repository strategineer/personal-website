There's a disproportiate number of people who know about anti-mask/anti-vaxxer protests compared to the number of people who actually participate in these protests.

I live in Montreal, a city with around 8 million living in and around it. There's a 100 people presumably who (at some point CHECK REF) decided to march against masks.

I heard about it, most of people I know heard about it.

Who cares to tell us this information?

Well let's take a step back and ask who controls the media?

[SHOW EXAMPLES OF THE MEDIA AND WHO at the help of them, washington post is an egregious example of this]

There are people in power (who've been able to amass the majority of the world's wealth [stat that 20% of people control 80% of the wealth] who have incentive to cooperate with each other and do everything they can to stay in power.

I'm not talking about the "Illumati", I'm not talking about your Qs and your As, I'm talking about people with shared interests cooperating with each other to keep us down.

[Mention Understanding Power, it talks about a lot but let's focus on media]

One way of doing that is through the media.

So back to the question, who benefits from repeateadly exposing the people of the world to images of anti-vaxxer protesters (who are few in number and low in the impact they actually have on the world if not for global media conglomerates boosting their signal)?

It associates the image of the protester with the image of an anti-vaxxer in our minds.

In doing so, it discourages the rest of us from going out there and protesting.

One day, I was hearing more car horns blaring than I've ever heard before outside. The first thought that jumped into my mind was: "Holy shit, is the world ending?". After that, it was: "Stupid anti-vaxxers". I did some research and it was actually the local public transporting workers's union fighting for their rights.

The rich rarely attempt to subvert and operate in secret to oppress the rest of us. They do so out in the open because it's easier.

Are you doing anything about it? Other than spreading the good word, I'm not doing much.
