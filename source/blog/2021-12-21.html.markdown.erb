I watched way more movies than I thought I did. Most of the movies I watched this year were very forgettable.

Here's a list of the movies I watched in 2021 in categories that describe how I felt about them (movies are unorded within categories)

### Movies I can't stop thinking about

- Johnny Mmenonic
-: _Keanu Reeves in a business suit going absolutely insane in a dystopian cyberpunk future._
-: Despite Keanu Reeves not knowing how to act and William Gibson being an overrated writer, this movie was fun to watch and I've been thinking about it ever since.

### Movies I loved
- She's the Man
- Paddington
- Escape from New York
- Bo Burnham: Inside
- Clueless
- White Chicks
- DEBS

### OK Movies
- Villains
- I Don't Feel at Home in this World anymore
- Little
- Bad Trip
- Fighting with my Family

### Movies that were bad but I enjoyed watching them anyway

- Chaos Walking

### Movies I forgot that I watched
- Moxie
- The DUFF

- The Vault
- Blinded by the Light
- Ode to Joy
- Up in the Air
- Rush Hour
- Not another teen movie
- Bloodshore
- Late Shift
- Zombieland Doubletap
- Mission Impossible
: _The mission is impossible... Or is it?_
: I must have seen parts of this movie before because I remembered a lot of the set pieces.
: Tom Cruise strikes again, he can do no wrong (on the screen).

- Another Round (2020)
: _Mads Mikkelsen plays a danish high school teacher. It's a black comedy that involves a lot of drinking._
: I liked movie. I recently got myself some bottles of vodka, gin and rum. If I'm not sure if that's related.
: "Don't go swimming when you're drunk."


- Mandy
: _Produced by our lord and saviour, Elijah Wood, Mandy is a psychedelic horror film directed by a Greek-Italian-Canadian director and starring Nicolas Cage... This one might be goooooooood._
: I went in expecting a comedy but nothing was funny? Nicholas Cage is doing a real bad job here. The first 45min were interesting and then it became mediocre John Wick.
