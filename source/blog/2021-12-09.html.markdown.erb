We landed on the planet, I began hunting and M started gathering resources and building a shelter. Eventually, we had enough fur to craft two full sets of fur armor, a necessity for travelling through the Artic region.

Two words: polar bear. Polar bears have killed us more times than we can count and so we ventured forth into the cold knowing that we might not be coming back safe and sound.

As soon as our boots stepped into the snow, we saw a polar bear in the distance. We avoided it, thinking that it was safer that way. We reached the drop pod, opening it to find a scanner. Three locations far away from us were pinged on the map for us. We would have to take the scanner to each one and turn it on and wait.

We've done this before, and something that's never mentioned is that the local wildlife, usually, does not appreciate the scanner's scanning. And so, we knew to expect a fight.

We could have decided to go back to our shelter and go through the arduous process of building some firearms. This would have helped with the whole "polar bear" situation just a little. Feeling confident in our ability to avoid any bears on the way to the first scanning location, I dropped some steaks for M (he forgot to bring food but he remembered to bring everything else we needed).

We snuck past a handful of bears on the way. Eventually, we reached the area and I placed the scanner into position. M began building a tiny 1x1 shack with 4 roof/floor tiles extending in each direction. He added a ladder as a final touch and climbed on top.

We thought that this area was clear of any big white furry balls of death but unfortunately... It was not. To make matters even worse, I couldn't climb the ladder. I would love to say that this was because I hadn't put enough points into upper body strength but actually the game's just a little buggy.

After my fifth attempt to try and climb the ladder, I asked M if we should just turn the scanner on because "fuck it".

He said yes. I jumped off the ladder and turned the scanner on.

We waited for the inevitable. A few moments later, one bear appeared from behind us and the one that was nearby started moving toward us.

Luckily, neither bear had any interest in me. They wanted to smash the tower to bits

we took out both of them, we survived the following blizzard (barely) by hiding in a worm infested cave (pneumomia is a bitch), and eventually we made our way back home.

We barely made it through in one piece. Next time we're bringing guns

We had no hopes of surviving our trek through the Artic region on the planet. Or so we thought.
