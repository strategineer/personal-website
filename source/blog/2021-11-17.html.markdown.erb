We're all constantly learning and unlearning behaviors for us to better match up with our idealized versions of ourselves.

As someone who struggled with being an asshole for more than two decades, there's only one way to go from here, up.

There's a lot of parts of life that don't come naturally to me. Although I really need to interact with other people on a regular basis to be happy, extended social interaction is draining for me. I can do a few hours and then I'm done.

I'm definitely an introvert (if that's even a thing) but interacting with people in the way that's expected of me doesn't come naturally for me. It requires me to be actively thinking about what I'm going to do next.
