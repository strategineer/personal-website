blurb: Limey and Giney. This drink prevents scurvy and that would be relevant information for you if you were a sailor 100+ years ago.
ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 oz Tanqueray gin
  - 1 oz homemade lime juice cordial
  - 1 lime wedge, for garnish
steps:
  - Stir and strain into an ice-filled old-fashioned glass. Add the garnish.
notes:
  - You can follow the recipe described [here](https://jeffreymorgenthaler.com/lime-cordial/) to make your own lime juice cordial.
  - Make sure to only zest the green skin of the limes. You don't want any of the white stuff in your cordial.
