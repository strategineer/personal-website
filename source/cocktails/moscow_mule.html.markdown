blurb: TBD
ingredients:
  - 2 oz vodka
  - 3 oz Fever Tree ginger beer
  - 2 lime wedges, for garnish
steps:
  - Build in an ice-filled highball glass. Add the garnish.
notes:
  - You can replace the 3 oz of ginger beer with a mix of ginger syrup and club soda to make the cocktail have a little less kick. I haven't tried this yet so I'm not exactly sure on the ratios.
