blurb: The mint garnish pokes at your nose while you drink this minty cocktail. If you like mint with your mint for more mint per square mint then this is the cocktail for you.
ingredients:
  - 4 lemon wedges (1 lemon = 6 wedges)
  - 2 teaspoons of granulated sugar
  - 5 fresh mint leaves
  - 2 1/2 of Tanqueray Gin
steps:
  - Muddle the lemon wedges, sugar, and mint leaves in a mixing glass until the sugar is completely dissolved, all the juice is extracted from the lemons, and the mint is thoroughly integrated into the juice.
  - Add ice and the gin to the mixing glass.
  - Shake and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Add the garnish.
