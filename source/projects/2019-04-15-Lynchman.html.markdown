blurb: Tool for generating Beat Saber maps from audio files automatically.
---
Lynchman was developed with python. It can be used for computing data based on Beat Saber (a Virtual Reality rhythm game where you're tasked with using your arms to slice fast moving blocks in time with music) maps and using that data to generate maps automatically (using Markov Chains) for given song files.

NB: The name of the project is based on the character Lynchman from one of the best animated movies of all time, Redline. He has a minor role in the movie but as an intergalactic mercenary for hire he spends a portion of his screen time stretching his arms and legs in preparation for his work, as one usually or should do before playing Beat Saber.
