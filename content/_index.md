# About Me

Welcome!

My name is Bill Tyros, though you might know me online as _strategineer_. I'm a software engineer by trade, with a lifelong love for sharing my thoughts through my writing.

Here on my website, I usually post about my favorite hobbies: video gaming, reading, and—most recently—tabletop roleplaying.

### Background
I've lived in Laval, a cozy city near Montreal (Quebec, Canada), ever since I arrived on the scene in the early '90s. I'm fluent in English and French. 

Gaming and reading have been my passions for as long as I can remember. Initially, they offered an escape from life's rougher edges.

Over the years, I've begun engaging with games and media more broadly through a more critical lens—an approach that's led to more meaningful experiences and conversations.
