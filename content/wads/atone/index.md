Unluckily, you've spawned right in the midst of a trap. The demons have already made it to Earth. It seems like you have just two options of atonement:

Save Earth or die trying.

- a megamad made by one person of 5 years, and it feels like it for better or worse.
- music is a little "coffebreak" a little elevator music, lacks the propulsive or mystical quality that I'm usually looking for.
- The first few maps are serviceable and interesting but lack a certain jenesaisquoi. These were created first in the author's DOOM mapping journey, so this makes sense. They've been touched up after the fact so they're not horrible but they're just OK.
- Music gets better after the first 1/3 (map12 track pretty great).
- 13: mall center, now we're "gaming", solid mapping
- 14: the music gets kicking here
- 15: back to low fi beat to kill demons to, not my favorite
- 16: music kicks in exactly at the halfway point
