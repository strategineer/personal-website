Set of 12 (?) levels that acts as a Primer on the genre of Doom maps filled with enemies called slaughter maps, AKA Baby's First Slaughter

- map06: interesting elevator with columns that all move at the same time and can be reset... Need to look at this in UDB
- very cool gameplay
- switches aren't always spotlighted very well so they can be easy to miss and you'll be forced to load up the map in UDB to find the switches necessarily for completion
- map10: really cool descent, hit a switch then ascent into a big fuck off slaughter arena. Open up UDB for this, must be a teleporter? (yes, it is... very cool)
- ya I'm opening almost every map in the 2nd half because what I'm supposed to do next isn't clear. Minimal foreshadowing of what you're supposed to do what you're supposed to activate
- amazing combat encounters universally across all the maps
- map12: secret (blood pit) leading to a shortcut through the map? that's really cool
  - crazy map: amazing way to end the wad, big fuck off map
