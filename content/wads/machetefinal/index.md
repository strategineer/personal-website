Those scum ridden sacks of shit didn't even have the empathy to honorably discharge me. I was just told to shut up and get out. I cleared a tech base of those nightmares and I bet they'd still rather see me dead than holding a place in the marines again. I don't need help, I just need to wipe out the rest of these terrors and get rid of that awful noise. Onward to Sunveil Starport.

- cacoaward 2023
- gameplay, using all the systems well and building on similar ideas in subsequent levels, optional harder sublevels within levels clearly marked as such (see an exit but you can keep going too)
- reusing the same arena and re-populutating it once or even twice with different enemies, efficient use of space
- cool custom enemies (cracked evil doom guy, ifrit)
- lvl 29... go through a part of a bunch of previous levels again but with different enemies/stakes... very cool
- what about the story? there's weird shit going on here
- a little slaughtery
- wacky credits (it never ends???), our hero?
- doing a lot with a little
