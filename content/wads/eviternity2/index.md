- I loved the first Eviternity, let's see how this holds up
- nice palette
- map01
  - crazy intro teleporter thing, let's check this in doombuilder
  - also revisiting levels from the first megawad but altered due to doomguy's efforts
  - jump pads still kind of wild, although a little glitchy
- map02
  - first button you hit, you see exactly what it activates in LOS
  - cool rain effect
- map03
  - leaves falling effect, cool...
- making the pistol fire faster is a classic great way of fixing the pistol feeling awful to use
- each map's exit allow you to see the start of the next map is brilliant
  - a lot of "high budget" choices like this bring this wad above and beyond others
  - the detailing in every room is just insane
- having a switch bring up some stairs with a switch on them allowing the player to "unlock" being able to activate these stairs up and down to access new areas seems key (not something new but something I was having trouble coming up with on my own during my most recent mapping session)
  - also, having really big stairs have a dedicated button next to them instead of on them
- map05 track is cool but doesn't fit...
