- I loved the first Eviternity, let's see how this holds up
- nice palette
- map01
  - crazy intro teleporter thing, let's check this in doombuilder
  - also revisiting levels from the first megawad but altered due to doomguy's efforts
  - jump pads still kind of wild, although a little glitchy
- map02
  - first button you hit, you see exactly what it activates in LOS
  - cool rain effect
- making the pistol fire faster is a classic great way of fixing the pistol feeling awful to use
