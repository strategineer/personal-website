- 1 super hot fire map
- insane music (doesn't loop properly though)
- cool visuals + combat encounters
- colour palette
- solid AF

Wads like this are convincing me that if you've got great music and shift the colour palette slightly combined with good level/combat encounter design, you're golden.
