After 12,000 linedefs of action, you have won this battle and have destroyed the source of this demonic civilization. Condemnation is no more and the mystery of this pandemic has finally been solved. As you hop onto the derelict imperial space station Ondor (sic) for the long journey back home you destroy the rest of these beasts with ease blasting them to oblivion.

- 400 line defs each megawad by one mapper (pcorf)
- mostly consistent map length feels good
- economy of design, reusing the same spaces over and over again. A little bit of difficulty in differentiating the levels. There's an intentional use of different textures-sets throughout but it's not enough to really make these maps feel really different.
- gradual expansion of arenas and combination of them as more monster closets are revealed.
- ... I like this more than I would have expected.
- a lot of random TPs used to move enemies around the arenas... interesting but hard to parse. Makes the maps feel a little random. It feels like a bandaid to solve the problem of wanting to have these maps be tiny but re-use the existing spaces a bunch... it doesn't fully work.
- map11: great example of this idea of opening an arena gradually
- timed buttons keep the pace up but sometimes slow you down when you miss the timing.
- singular/low rocket ammo drops, forces tactical rocket use more than usual
- maps separated into mostly thematic episodes with different map design ethos/pillars in each it feels like... it's good 
- 2020 pandemic-inspired story line
