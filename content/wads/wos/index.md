- collab between pcorf and Aro
- fantastic original midi soundtrack, with both pcorf and Aro being talented musicians
- map9: the school, a no russian-esque map, an explicit reference to columbine? That massacre directly led to Doom coming up in the news and being villified and being accused of "causing" it. Now here's a Doom map that's explicitly about going into a "school" and blasting through hordes of "demons". The music hits here, it's melancholic and it feels like it represents the loss of innocence. 
- very tight ammo setup (tightest I've played recently, every bullet is essential, waste is lethal)
