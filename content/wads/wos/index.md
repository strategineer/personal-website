- collab between pcorf and Aro
- fantastic original midi soundtrack, with both pcorf and Aro being talented musicians
- map9: the school, a no russian-esque map, an explicit reference to columbine? That massacre directly led to Doom coming up in the news and being villified and being accused of "causing" it. Now here's a Doom map that's explicitly about going into a "school" and blasting through hordes of "demons". The music hits here, it's melancholic and it feels like it represents the loss of innocence. 
- very tight ammo setup (tightest I've played recently, every bullet is essential, waste is lethal)
- a lot of time spent with the shotgun, smashing your head against bullet sponges. Enemy composition choices are questionable at times, it seems like the mappers were more interested in creating a hopeless vibe instead of purely "fun" gameplay
- maps get super long past the 1/2 mark
- map25: sneaky cyberdemon teleporting around ominously, very cool
- ubiquitous crosses, inverted, normal, orthodox, but just generally there's a lot of indented decoration in walls. It's used a little too much maybe but it does provide the dozen maps of the wad with a unique look/feel
- map26: organ music at start, great vibes for the evil cathedral setting of the map
- too long, overstays its welcome because the combat isn't "fun" enough to hold the rest of it up?
- this has some really iconic set pieces / scenes (map30: hell-levator) but they're spread a little because the maps are so long
- ammo counts a little sus, even when making full use of chainsaw / berserk punching, you just don't have enough. Although I can get a little better at punching demons
