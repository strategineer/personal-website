- inspired by Going Down (mouldy)? The first track is by him and the concept seems related. AshtralFiend's participation in this collab would make sense if that's the case because mouldy's work seems related to his generally.
  - Going Up?
- tiny maps (1024x1024)
- these tiny maps really fit with most of what AshtralFiend has worked on so far, they seem fascinated by tiny tight maps
- flr07: tight wave-based arena fight, feels pretty good
- a lot of doomcute
- flr15: using single skull next to doors to show that following this path will give you the appropriate skull/key, something to do myself
- flr22: AshtralFiend feels like a main character in this community project, his maps stand out. This one is kind of wild, finally walking around the tower and being able to fall all the way down.
