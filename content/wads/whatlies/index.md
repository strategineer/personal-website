- gothic horror, moody, starts off entering a spooky mansion and descending into the dungeon...
- sort of like wad where you go up an elevator in a skyscraper but reversed?
- vibes on point, gameplay not as tight, feels a little random enemy spawn-wise
- great music
- lack of consistency in vision and game mechanics and progression of ideas..., too many cooks, but each level has a lot of love put into it
- map4 blacksite: sick
- I think I'd take a group of less interesting less good maps that are thematically vibewise and gameplay wise cohesive than hodge podge of better maps 
- map8: where fools always trespass, elevator sequence
- really too hodge podgy mix and match, lack of cohesion, but the highs are high. not my preference but very cool levels in here
- map11: falling platforms section
- last map might be a little too big
