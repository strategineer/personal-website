- 01: button that doesn't do anything, that's the kind of thing I'm expecting from Monti. Wacky shit
- 02: dayum, this music track, lounge music? wild choice
- A lot of the textures being used, I've never seen them used this way but they feel consistent with each other. I think this is one of Monti's signature moves. It makes his work (so far) feel different yet consistent and not ugly.
- no rocket launchers so far (unless they're hidden), makes me sad. But maybe when I get it eventually it'll be great, delayed gratification in Doom lol

random thoughts: Doom custom maps 30 years in, it's inherently meta, it's its own thing and universe, the mappers through their maps are speaking to each other, speaking to the maps in the original games...

- 3: actively uses ghosts monsters to fuck you, a mean and tough map, I'll need to go back to this one and figure it out. Maybe getting the rocket launcher and then taking the arch-vile out before it creates the ghosts monsters?
- 4: wtf is this music track? so jarring between the levels, big shifts tonally

- all the pickups have been changed as well
- hardest and meanest wad I've played recently
- constantly gives you a weapon that isn't appropriate for the encounter you're about to have which is the opposite of what you're used to

- 9: absolutely deranged music track choice, monti is a wild mapper
- evil dehacked monster changes, weak enemies move 10% faster and it seems like the big boys have 10x the health, toxic
