- oozing style
- most of AshtralFiend's work uses an altered color palette which makes sense, directors do colour grading, painters pick and mix their paint, the color palette is a part of the Doom mapping toolset, they use it effectively
- map01: take on first level of Doom or Doom II?
- these maps are just a little too easy but everything else about them is anything
- ya every level has a different color palette, very cool
- map03: mbf21 transparent textures?
- pistons! pistons everywhere, check these out in UDB
