Everything I know about the Haste Any% Speedrun all in one place.

I'm currently last on the leaderboard by a substantial margin so don't take this too seriously.

Last updated for version 1.3a of Haste

# Basics

## Skip as many Fragment (level) nodes as you can

After the first fragment level in a shard, you'll be presented with a node map. Now you should select a path through the whole node map that hits the least number of nodes, favoring shop nodes, rest nodes, challenge nodes and encounter nodes because they are the quickest to complete.

## Jump into the void in challenge nodes

Self-explanatory. You won't lose a life for this and it's usually much quicker to die than to complete a challenge node even though you'll be missing out on some kind of reward.

## Maximising Boost

Any Boost stat that you've acquired in a run through items, only applies when Zoe is grounded. So if your Boost stat is high then consider staying more grounded.

However diving into deep slopes also increases your speed substantially so keep that in mind too.

# Tricks

## Boss Cutcene Skip

Difficulty: Easy

After you've attacked a boss for the last pip on their health bar, you can open the pause menu and select "Abandon Shard" to save a few seconds waiting for the scene transition.

Then after hitting the "Complete Shard" button, open the pause menu and select the "exit" (?) button. Then click continue game on the main menu to skip through another dialogue/cutscene. 

## Shop/Rest Back Portal 

Difficulty: Easy

When entering a Shop/Rest node you can turn around and exit from the portal behind you which is closer to you than the one in front of you.

## Cowl Pumping

Difficulty: Easy

Using the Cowl (which you can buy for 1000 antishards after shard 3), you can land then activate the cowl right away to get a ~10 m/s second speed boost each time up to about 140-150m/s.

## Quick Convoy

Difficulty: Hard

You can clip through the front of the Convoy then bounce around its weakpoint to kill it without having to run around it repeatedly.

The clip seems to be easier when moving slower (60m/s) but I've never achieved this so who knows.
