# Terminology

TBD Let's name all the "things" in the game.

# Pathing

## Tutorial skip / Speedrun mode

Importance: Essential

Difficulty: Easy

Secret path that skips the tutorial and decreases the number of cutscenes you need to button through.

# Tricks

## Juan Arm Climb

*Other names: Popeye Special*

Importance: Essential

Difficulty: Easy

Holding on to something drains stamina. Holding on with one hand and spinning drains a lot of stamina.

If you run out of stamina, you fall and that's not good in a game where you're trying to go up as fast as possible.

The Juan Arm Climb involves you holding the left stick in the direction you want to go towards and lightly tapping the left or right bumpers rhythmically as your character swings themselves upwards with minimal stamina use.

You can also use this to climb on vertical cliffs/walls.

## Juan Hop

*Other names: Nkop's Hop, Vaulting, Juan Sebasti√°n Vega Arias*

Importance: Essential

Difficulty: Medium

{{< youtube BttT1muoj64 193 >}}

Flings you super far if done right. It's not consistent enough to be used all the time but if you need the momentum/distance and you don't need to be too precise, it's worth a try.

1. Jump while airborne. You can do this off of a grounded jump or while letting go of a wall.
2. Grab a background wall with both hands (pressing the bumpers at slightly different times might work better).
3. Spin the stick around (can't explain this, you'll have to get a feel for it yourself).
4. If you've done it right, one or both of your arms will be extended/stretched in a weird way. Let go of both bumpers when your character's momentum is moving in the direction you want to go.

Resetting from this is possible if you didn't do it right. Just let go of one hand and starting swinging with the other.

I learned this from @knop868 on Discord.
