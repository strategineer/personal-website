# Pathing

## Tutorial skip / Speedrun mode

Saves: ~10min

Difficulty: Easy

Secret path that skips the tutorial and decreases the number of cutscenes you need to button through.

I learned this from @miphos on Discord.

## Zone 3 - Route 1 - Camera Omar Skip

Saves: ~1min

Difficulty: Easy

Skips a whole cutscene with Omar.

{{< youtube BttT1muoj64 1244 >}}

I learned this myself.

## Zone 4 - Route 1 - Rocks on Omar Skip

Saves: ~2-3min

Difficulty: Easy

At some point (might be route dependent) you'll find Omar with a ton of rocks on him, going near him will start what feels like the longest dialogue in the game.

You can avoid that by going left and making use of an item to climb over an unclimbable wall.

TBD Video for this one.

I learned this myself.

# Tricks

## Juan Arm Climb

*Other names: Popeye Special*

Importance: Essential

Difficulty: Easy

{{< youtube BttT1muoj64 623 >}}

Holding on to something drains stamina. Holding on with one hand and spinning drains a lot of stamina.

If you run out of stamina, you fall and that's not good in a game where you're trying to go up as fast as possible.

The Juan Arm Climb involves you holding the left stick in the direction you want to go towards and lightly tapping the left or right bumpers rhythmically as your character swings themselves upwards with minimal stamina use.

You can also use this to climb on vertical cliffs/walls.

I learned this from @miphos on Discord.

## Juan Hop

*Other names: Nkop's Hop, Vaulting, Juan Sebasti√°n Vega Arias*

Importance: Essential

Difficulty: Medium

{{< youtube BttT1muoj64 193 >}}

Flings you super far if done right. It's not consistent enough to be used all the time but if you need the momentum/distance and you don't need to be too precise, it's worth a try.

1. Jump while airborne. You can do this off of a grounded jump or while letting go of a wall.
2. Grab a background wall with both hands (pressing the bumpers at slightly different times might work better).
3. Spin the stick around (can't explain this, you'll have to get a feel for it yourself).
4. If you've done it right, one or both of your arms will be extended/stretched in a weird way. Let go of both bumpers when your character's momentum is moving in the direction you want to go.

Resetting from this is possible if you didn't do it right. Just let go of one hand and starting swinging with the other.

I learned this from @knop868 on Discord.

# Consumable Item Tier List

Rocket
: S - It launches you super far, super fast. It can be used effectively anywhere on the map.

Hook Shot / Rope
: S - The all-around good tool. Perfect for saving you from unexpected falls or allowing you to catch your breath after a long climb. You can retract the rope super fast by holding down on the D-pad and extend it by holding up. Interestingly you can climb on the hook itself once it's attached to something. This can come in handy if you're trying to climb on an unclimbable wall.

Parachute
: S - It'll save you from falling to your death. It activates automatically if you have it selected and you start falling or you can activate it manually like any other item. Switching back and forth between something like the Hook Shot and the Parachute when doing risky maneuvers seems like a good safety trick. The parachute deactivates when you touch the ground, it makes climbing upwards awkward and slow so keep that in mind.

Snacks/Food
: A - An instant stamina boost from 0 to 300% is really good. The only reason it's not S tier is because munching on an energy bar won't save you from falling to your death.

Teleporter
: B - It teleports you, it can even teleport you through walls. Not as useful as you might think because the range is short and it's rare for walls to keep you away from a good route. Although I'm sure as more uses for the Teleporter are discovered it'll 

Climbing Chalk
: B - You can't use this in-game, you have to open the menu to use is. This isn't fast. The climbing chalk doesn't last very long. I'm also I haven't found a real use case for the 

Spike
: C - You can shoot this at a unclimbable wall and then use climb with it. Not super useful. Apparently someone threw the spike and it attached to them allowing them to climb anywhere using the spike attached to themselves or something like that. TBD

Bounce Pad
: C - Inconsistent and it doesn't do very much on its own. It might be useful for launching yourself into a solid wall and glitching your way up (I don't know if this is possible but maybe?). This is the first item I get rid of if I need to make space in my inventory.

Let me know if I missed any consumable items!

# Equippable Item Tier List

Stamina Boost Wife Beater
: S - More Stamina More Good.

High Jump Shoes
: A - Makes you jump higher. No brainer on this one.

Long Arm Sweater
: C - Probably not worth using. Makes climbing feel different and weird. I'd have to practice a bunch with this sweater before I would be comfortable using it in a run.

Helmet
: D - You shouldn't be getting hurt in the first place, and if you do you should have some food on you or around you to nibble on to get that stamina back. This is a waste of an item slot IMO.

Let me know if I missed any equippable items!

# Mushrooms

I have no clue how mushrooms work, I'm not sure if their effects are randomized or not.

All I know is that:
- I ate a stubby green (I think?) mushroom that made me move really fast.
- I ate a tall purple (I think?) mushroom that made me constantly lose stamina.

Mushrooms are rare and eating them seems like kind of a crap shoot. I'm probably going to do it anyway for knowledge but I don't think it's "good".

# Terminology

TBD Let's name all the "things" in the game.
