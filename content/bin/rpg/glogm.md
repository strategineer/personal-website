This system is heavily based on [Many Rats on a Stick by Skerples](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html). [Download PDF](/rpg/many_rats_on_stick_v2.pdf) and refer to it for classes info and various tables (for now).

# Core Rules

Spiked Goblin Punch is based on Arnold K.'s "Goblin Laws of Gaming" homebrew, also known as the GLOG.

This rules set is designed for old-school D&D-like games. It is broadly compatible with most published Old School Revival (OSR) products (i.e. equally incompatible with all of them). The main goal is to create a system that is:

1. Intuitive for new players.
2. Adaptable and hackable.
3. Compact.

This PDF assumes you know what an RPG is, what dice are, and the basics of OSR games, and how to adjudicate rules on the fly. Rather than a complete system, this hack is designed to allow experience GMs to run games for experienced players.

In short, there are bits missing. Read another, much more complete OSR system, then all in the missing bits.

### GM Guidance

Only roll or call for a roll if both success and failure are interesting. If failure is inevitable because of the fiction, don't roll. A PC can't test Strength to flap their arms and fly to the moon. If failure is boring, don't roll. If the PCs fail to pick a simple mundane lock, and they have all the time in the world, they'll just keep rolling until they succeed. Just let them open it or apply a time penalty. If the PCs not spotting something means they'll never see it, just tell them what they see. No rolls required.

Failed rolls have consequences. The most obvious one is time. Wasted time means more chances for bad things to happen to the PCs.

Roll sparingly. Because stats are randomly generated and assigned, it's possible two PCs in the same party will have vastly different chances of performing the same task. Minimize this by using Attack and Save (which are the same for most Pcs at the same level), automatic failures, and automatic successes.

From a player's point of view, a roll is a risk. Testing Strength to leap across a chasm is risky. Putting a ladder across a chasm and climbing across is less risky and does not require a roll. Fighting is a risk. Avoiding the fight entirely may not require a roll.

### The Core Mechanic

Almost everything is based on rolling a d20. If you roll equal to or under a target number, you succeed. Roll over, and you fail.

Throughout the text, whenever you see "Roll under...", it means "Roll equal to or under..." It's just a pain to write that out every single time.

### Skills

Skills are just a word that describes something a PC knows how to do. There are no specific rules for using them. You may call for rolls under Intelligence or another stat, but in general, just let the PC with the skill do the thing the skill describes.

| Stat | Bonus | Stat | Bonus | Stat | Bonus |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| 1    | -3    | 9    | 0     | 17   | 2     |
| 2    | -3    | 10   | 0     | 18   | 3     |
| 3    | -2    | 11   | 0     | 19   | 3     |
| 4    | -2    | 12   | 1     | 20   | 3     |
| 5    | -2    | 13   | 1     | 21   | 4     |
| 6    | -1    | 14   | 1     | 22   | 4     |
| 7    | -1    | 15   | 2     | 23   | 4     |
| 8    | -1    | 16   | 2     | 24   | 5     |

### Stats

Characters have 6 stats. Each stat has a "bonus", which is a sort of shorthand condensation of a stat. Don't add the bonus to rolls.

**Strength**: Roll under Strength to open doors, tear apart chains, or climb a cliff. The number of items a character can carry is determined by their Strength score. The damage a character inflicts in melee combat is modified by their Strength bonus.

**Dexterity**: Roll under Dexterity to dodge traps, leap over obstacles, or perform delicate tasks under pressure. A character's Defense, Movement, and Stealth are modified by their dexterity bonus.

**Constitution**: Roll under Constitution to resist cold, disease, fatigue, drowning, and poison. A character's Hit Points are based on their Constitution.

**Intelligence**: Roll under Intelligence to solve difficult puzzles, read obscure texts, or identify items and treasure.

**Wisdom**: Roll under Wisdom to see through lies, spot hidden dangers, and avoid mind-altering spells. Characters will also use Wisdom to determine the order of combat.

**Charisma**: Roll under Charisma to flatter, beguile, or barter. A character's Save is modified by their Charisma bonus.

### Associated Numbers

**Attack**: Starts at 11. Increases with level. Roll under Attack, opposed by the enemy's Defense, to hit.

**Defense**: 10 + Dex. Bonus or bonus from armour. Leather is +2, Chain is +4, Plate is +6, a shield is +1.

**Movement**: 12 + Dex. Bonus. How fast a character can move. Penalized by armour (-0 for leather, -2 for Chain, -4 for Plate).

**Stealth**: 5 + Dex. Bonus. Applied as a penalty to opponents Wisdom to see if a character is noticed. Penalized by armour (-0 for leather, -2 for Chain, -4 for Plate).

**Save**: 5 + Cha. Bonus. Increases with level. If an effect, attack, or challenge doesn't fall under any of the other stats or values, roll Save. This represents a character's luck and determination to resist the cruel hand of fate.

### Opposed Rolls

A character or NPC must roll equal to or under their stat, modified by 10-[the relevant stat of their opponent].

E.g. Shoving. The PC has 11 Strength, the orc has 14 Strength. The PC needs to roll a 7 or less to succeed (11 + [10-14] ).

Chess. The PC has a Intelligence of 6, the goblin has an Intelligence of 4. The PC needs to roll a 12 or less to succeed.

Racing. The PC has a Movement of 12, the gladiator has a Movement of 14. The PC must roll under 8 to thoroughly beat the gladiator in a race.

### Adjudicating Rolls

A -4 penalty is approximately the same as "reroll and take the worse of the two results." A +4 bonus is approximately the same as "reroll and take the better result."

Apply bonuses or penalties to rolls as needed. Go as far as you need to go, bearing in mind that if you're adding enough bonuses or penalties rolling may be pointless.

# Combat

### Combat

Switch to combat rounds when it looks like someone might get hurt.

If someone (or a group) attacks by surprise, they get to act before any Initiatives are rolled for the round. Once all ambushers have acted, everyone rolls for Initiative.

### Initiative

Each round of combat, a PC must roll under their Wisdom. If they succeed, they act before their enemies. If they fail, they act afterwards. They act in order of their rolls, lowest to highest. Some particularly quick enemies might impose a penalty on PCs' Wisdom, or act twice in each round.

### On Their Turn

A PC or enemy can do one of the following:

- Make an Attack roll against a target.
- Run about 50'+Movement (or 60').
- Make a charge attack against a target (Move 20'+Movement and then make an Attack roll).
- Cast a spell or activate a magic item.
- Retrieve an item from a non-quickdraw slot.
- Reload a crossbow, etc.
- Try to trip, shove, or push a target.
- Attempt to remove a Fatal Wound from a dying ally.

In addition, a PC or enemy can move 20'+Movement (or 30').

Talking, shouting, or dropping an item can be done freely, and possibly even in other peoples' turns. Basically, you can do one big thing a turn, plus move a bit.

### Attack Rolls

Roll under Attack, opposed by the enemy's Defense, to hit.

E.g. A 1st-level Thief with Attack 11 tries to hit a goblin with no armour. The Thief has to roll under 11.

A 1st-level Thief with Attack 11 tries to hit a very nimble tiger (armour as chain). The Thief has to roll under 7 (11+ [10-14] ).

Other effects (drunkenness, fog, being on fire, etc.) may impose penalties to Attack.

Ranged weapons get -1 to Attack for every 10' beyond their listed range.

Most spells do not require an Attack roll. If a spell does require one, it will be noted in the spell's description. Touching an unwilling target always requires an Attack roll.

#### Critical Successes and Failures

On an unmodified Attack roll of 1, the attack deals double damage (roll twice the number of dice and add any bonuses twice).

On an unmodified Attack roll of 20, the attack automatically misses. Further penalties may apply if the situation is risky. A critical failure in a one-on-one fight in a clear meadow might just be a miss. A critical failure in a tight corridor, with allies and enemies jostling together, might result in an ally being hit, a weapon being dropped, or the attacker falling prone.

### Damage

- **Light weapons** (daggers) deal 1d6 + Strength bonus damage.
- **Medium weapons** (swords) deal 1d8 + Strength bonus damage if wielded in one hand or 1d10 + Strength bonus damage if wielded in both hands.
- **Heavy weapons** (hammers) deal 1d12 + Strength bonus damage but must be wielded in both hands.
- **Thrown light weapons** deal 1d6 damage.
- **Bows** and **Slings** deal 1d6 damage.
- **Crossbows** deal 1d12 damage.

### Hit Points

The danger a character can resist before taking injury is quantified by Hit Points (HP). They are better thought of as "Don't Get Hit" Points. There are no mechanical effects for being reduced to 0 HP. Any damage in excess of this (i.e. negative HP) is known as Lethal Damage, which always incurs a roll on the Death and Dismemberment Table.

PCs have a maximum HP of 20. Enemies have variable HP base on their Hit Dice (HD). A hit dice is a d8. Roll the number of HD listed and add the numbers together. An enemy with surprisingly low HP might be sickly or wounded. An enemy with high HP might be a champion (or two enemies).

### Healing

1. Lunch heals a character for 1d6+Level HP. Lunch takes 1 hour, requires a safe place, and consumes 1 ration.
2. A Good Night's Rest. Restores all HP. Requires 8 hours of rest, a safe place, a fire or heat source, and consumes 1 ration.
3. Magical Healing. Some spells or potions restore HP. Others can heal Injuries.

If a character has negative HP (i.e. has taken Lethal Damage), the next Lunch or Good Night's Rest heals them to 0 and not over 0.

### Weapon Proficiency

All classes are proficient with daggers. A PC is also proficient with any weapons they gain from a class or background. A PC has -4 to Attack with a weapon until they gain proficiency by landing 8 successful hits in combat.

### Reaction & Morale Rolls

When encountering monsters, roll 2d6 + the Charisma bonus of the most visible party member.

| 2d6+       | Result           | Notes                        |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 2 or less  | Immediate Attack | Offended or disgusted        |
| 3-7        | Unfavourable     | May attack if victory likely |
| 8-11       | Favourable       | Parley or bargaining         |
| 12 or more | Very Favourable  | May choose to cooperate.     |

Monsters (or hirelings) may try to run away or surrender if combat turns against them. Monsters have a Morale value listed from 2 (craven) to 12 (unbreakable). Check Morale when:

1. The side (PCs or monsters) takes their first death.
2. When half the side has been incapacitated or killed.
3. If some particularly frightening or spectacular effect occurs. Roll 2d6. If the result is over the creatures' Morale score, the creature attempts to retreat, surrenders, or panics. Morale can be adjusted (unless 2 or 12) by situational bonuses.

# Death & Dismemberment Table

#### Death and Dismemberment Roll

1d12+ Lethal Damage + Number of Current Injuries

The effects are cumulative. If a PC with -8 HP and no current Injuries rolls a 10 on a d12, to the leg, X = 10+8+0 = 18. They gain 4 Fatal Wounds, the leg is Mangled, and also Disabled for 18 days.

If they took a further 1 point of damage (-9 HP), they would roll 1d12 + 9 (Lethal Damage) + 1 (Mangled) + 1 (Disabled) for 1d12+11.

##### Hit Location Table

If required, roll 1d6 for hit location.

| Result | 1. Arm | 2. Leg | 3-4. Torso | 5-6. Head |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1+ | Disabled X Days | Disabled X Days | Cracked Ribs X Days | Concussed X Days |
| 11+ | 1 Fatal Wound + Mangled | 1 Fatal Wound + Mangled | 1 Fatal Wound + Crushed | 1 Fatal Wound + Skullcracked |
| 16+ | X-15 Fatal Wounds | X-15 Fatal Wounds | X-15 Fatal Wounds | X-15 Fatal Wounds |

##### Status Effect Table

If required, roll 1d6 for status effect.

| Result | Acid, Fire / Cold, Ice | Lightning | Venom / Toxin | Magic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1+ | Scorched / Frostbite X Days | Burned X Days | Sickened X Days | Anathema X Days |
| 11+ | 1 Fatal Wound + Burned / Frozen | 1 Fatal Wound + Fried | 1 Fatal Wound + Wracked | 1 Fatal Wound + Marked |
| 16+ | X-15 Fatal Wounds | X-15 Fatal Wounds | X-15 Fatal Wounds | X-15 Fatal Wounds |

### Fatal Wounds

A PC has 3 rounds to clear all their Fatal Wounds or they die. They can attempt to remove a Fatal Wound on their turn by rolling 1 on a d6. PCs with Fatal Wounds are unconscious. This does not mean they are quiet or asleep (they can be screaming and holding a stump), but it means they cannot take conscious or deliberate actions. Remove oldest Fatal Wounds first. You may want to use different coloured d6s to represent Fatal Wounds acquired on different rounds.

Up to two adjacent allies can try to remove Fatal Wounds from a dying character by spending their turn doctoring the wounded PC and then rolling under ½ Intelligence (unless they have a useful skill).

### Injuries

Some injuries on this list aren't on the Death and Dismemberment table. They can be accumulated by other means, GM choice, or deliberate actions.

**Anathema**: Cannot benefit from magical healing or be the target of beneficial magic.

**Blind**: Cannot see. -8 to Attack and Defense. Automatically hit by area-of-effect attacks. Burned / Frozen: Save. If failed, roll on the table below. If passed, lose 1d6 digits (roll randomly using a d20) and reduce all future damage of the appropriate type (acid, fire, ice, etc.) by 2.

1. Lose 2d6 digits.
2. Lose all but 1 digit.
3. Lose both hands.
4. Lose both feet.
5. Lose both hands, both feet, and nose. -2 Charisma.

**Concussed**: The PC's Wisdom becomes 4 for Initiative.

**Deaf**: Cannot hear. If ambushed, always act last.

**Disabled**: The injured limb becomes unusable. A Disabled arm cannot hold anything; held items are dropped. A Disabled leg cannot support the PC's weight. A PC with two working arms but no working legs can move at 1/20th their normal Movement.

**Fried**: Save. If failed, roll on the table below. If passed, reduce all future lightning damage by 2 and gain an Interesting Scar.

1. Deaf.

If passed, the PC has a permanent -2 to Save against magic, but reduces all incoming magic damage by 2. They also gain an Interesting Scar (known as a curse-mark). Scorched / Frostbite: Cannot wear armour. Difficulty gripping or climbing.

1. Permanently lose 1 from a random stat.
2. Permanently lose 1 from all stats.
3. Lose a random limb and one eye. -1 to range attacks. If both eyes lost, Blind.
4. Lose 2 from Strength and Constitution. Gain +1 to Intelligence and Wisdom.
5. Enfeebled. Take double damage from ingested poisons or rotten food.

### Interesting Scars

The scar must be a mangled, twisted, gnarled thing, a worm of flesh buried under the skin. It provides a +2 bonus to Charisma while interacting with people who appreciate a good scar and a good story (barbarians, barber-surgeons, knights, suitors, poets, etc.)

# Inventory & Items

## Inventory Slots

PCs have a number of Inventory Slots equal to their Strength. Only items carried count towards this limit. Horses, hirelings, and carts do not count. Clothing, minor non-magical jewellery, and other cosmetic items do not take up inventory slots unless they are particularly bulky.

An Inventory Slot can contain:

- 3 Light Weapons (daggers)
- 1 Medium Weapon (sword)
- 0.5 Heavy Weapons (hammers)
- 1 Bow
- 20 Arrows
- 3 Bottles or Flasks
- 1 Lantern
- 3 Books
- 3 Rations

The first 3 Inventory Slots are Quick-Draw Slots, and can be accessed at any time. It takes 1 round to retrieve an item from any other Inventory Slot.

Inventory management is crucial. Selecting and tracking problem-solving tools is a player skill.

### Encumbrance

Any items in excess of a character's Inventory Slots (Strength) gain 1 point of Encumbrance per slot. Each point of Encumbrance imposes a -1 penalty to Stealth, Movement, and Defense.

With 6 or more points of Encumbrance, moving quickly is impossible. With 10 or more points of Encumbrance, moving beyond a crawl is exhausting.

### Fatigue

Sprinting repeatedly, outdoor travel without rest, or excessively tiring activities inflict Fatigue. Each level of Fatigue takes up 1 Inventory Slot. It is usually removed by resting.

### Armour

- **Leather** armour takes up 0 Inventory Slots and provides +2 to Defense.
- **Chain** armour takes up 2 Inventory Slots and provides a +4 bonus to Defense. It also imposes a -2 penalty to Movement and Stealth.
- **Plate** armour takes up 4 Inventory Slots and provides a +6 bonus to Defense. It also imposes a -4 penalty to Movement and Stealth.
- **Shields** take up 1 Inventory Slot and provide a +1 bonus to Defense. A PC can sunder their shield to reduce incoming damage by 1d12. The shield is broken afterwards.

### Melee Weapons

- **Light weapons** (daggers) take up 1/3rd of an Inventory Slot and deal 1d6 + Strength bonus damage in melee.
- **Medium weapons** (swords) take up 1 Inventory Slot and deal 1d8 + Strength bonus damage if wielded in one hand or 1d10 + Strength bonus damage if wielded in both hands.
- **Heavy weapons** (hammers) deal 1d12 + Strength bonus damage but must be wielded in both hands.

### Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons get -1 to Attack for every 10' beyond their listed range.

- **Thrown light weapons** (daggers) take up 1/3rd of an Inventory Slot and deal 1d6 damage and have a 20' range.
- **Slings** take up 1 inventory slot. They deal 1d6 damage and have a 20' range.
- **Bows** take up 1 inventory slot. They deal 1d6 damage and have a 30' range.
- **Crossbows** take up 1 inventory slot. They deal 1d12 damage and have a 30' range. A crossbow takes 1 round to reload.

Both bows and crossbows use arrows. One Inventory Slot can contain 20 arrows. After combat, arrows can be recovered. 50% will be usable.

### Light Sources

Outside of the listed light range, light sources illuminate shadows. Vague shapes, movement, and reflective surfaces will be visible in shadows, but no details can be distinguished.

| Light Source | Radius                 | Duration               |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Torch        | 20' light, 20' shadows | 1 hour                 |
| Lantern      | 30' light, 30' shadows | 3 hours / flask of oil |
| Candle       | 5' light, 10' shadows  | 1 hour                 |

Lighting a torch or lantern takes 1 round. PCs are assumed to be carrying basic firestarting gear. Magic or cantrips may ignite a light source immediately.

## Hirelings

Hired at a fixed rate (see the price list). Dangerous work may require bonuses. Generic hirelings have 10 in all stats, 5 HP, and no skills outside their profession.

PCs can have up to 2+their Charisma bonus hirelings without any issues. Characters from the Second Estate can have up to 6+their Charisma bonus. Extra hirelings can be acquired, but may be disloyal, cunning, or poor quality.

Above any items required for their job, a hireling can carry 3 Inventory Slots worth of items for the PC.

# Dungeon & Wilderness Procedures

Time tracking is critical. I use minutes and hours.

## Dungeon Procedures

### Movement

PCs can cautiously move 20 10' squares (200') in 10 minutes . Round up to the nearest 10 minutes. PCs moving cautiously spot signs of all traps. The fun part isn't noticing the trap, it's how to disarm it. No skills. Use common sense and inventory items.

PCs can quickly move 60 10' squares (600') in 10 minutes. PCs moving incautiously may get a chance to roll under Wisdom to notice a trap (GM's discretion). Otherwise, they find traps via HP and hirelings.

If you want to modify these movement rates based on Movement, use 20'+the lowest Movement in the group for cautious movement and 3x that value for rapid movement. In practice, it rarely seems to matter.

### Searching

- A cursory search of a 20'x20' room takes 1 minute and reveals only the most obvious information.
- A proper search takes 30 minutes and reveals most hidden information.
- A detailed search takes 1 hour and reveals all hidden information.
- Multiple PCs can combine their efforts to search a larger room in the same time or a smaller room in less time.

### Random Encounters

Roll for a Random Encounter every 30 minutes or whenever a loud noise occurs. Usually, that's a 1 on a d6. Some people use an overloaded/hazard dice, where results of 2-6 do anything from ticking down light sources to providing clues. I don't bother. Time tracking works just as well.

If the PCs are moving cautiously, they get the Omen before the encounter. If they are moving quickly or incautiously, they don't get the Omen.

Roll 2d6 for Morale. If the result is equal to or under Morale, the creature is hostile. If over, positive or uncertain. Modify Morale by anything from +4 to -4 depending on circumstances.

### Light

Review the Light rules. Lanterns illuminate 30' clearly and provide dim outlines and shadows for a further 30'. In the dark, light sources are visible miles away.

### Other Activities

- Picking a mundane lock takes 10 minutes.
- Identifying a magic item takes 10 minutes.
- Deciphering an inscription, reading a book, or sorting through items takes 30 minutes.
- Lunch takes 1 hour. Test for random encounters twice.
- There are about 6 combat rounds in 1 minute. Don't worry about the exact number of rounds. Just assume combat, a breather afterwards, and looting take about 10 minutes.
- Eyeball other activities based on real-life experience. Round up a bit.

## Wilderness Procedures

Hexes are 6 hours across. Not miles, hours. If miles are needed, the PCs can travel 30 miles a day. Horses don't let the PCs travel more quickly, but they do make the journey easier.

Every hex travelled on foot fills 1 Inventory Slot with Fatigue. Riding a horse or a cart negates the Fatigue gain unless the weather is terrible or the road is very rough.

Hexes contain an obvious feature (something the PCs will encounter) and a Hidden Feature (something the PCs might encounter if they search the hex, spend time there, or visit multiple times).

Test for a random encounter every 6 hours or whenever the PCs make a lot of noise or do something that's likely to attract attention. Usually, that's a 1 on a d6.

Roll for the weather each day.

Most activities take 1 hour.

PCs can safely travel for 12 hours per day (2 hexes), or push their luck with 18 hours (3 hexes), losing the benefits of resting and having lunch.

In Civilized Parts, villages and peasants are everywhere. In wilderness areas, roads may not exist. All land is owned, even trackless wastes.

# Introduction for New Players

**There are elements of chance.**: Ever played cops and robbers or any other made-up games? Did you ever meet the one kid who said "Nuh uh, you didn't hit me, I have a bulletproof vest!" In this game of make-believe, there are a few rules to help decide who hits who, and how hard, and other things like that.

**Your characters are also going to have some random numbers assigned to them. Sometimes the numbers will be good, and sometimes they'll be bad, and there's not much you can do about it. In this game the numbers aren't that important. Sometimes, a character will terrible stats and survive for ages, while a character with brilliant stats dies in the first hour of game. There are elements of skill.**: In Settlers of Catan, the rules are fixed and solid and balanced. You can't go "Hey Steve, I'll take my Knights and you take your Knights and we'll go pillage that Sheep tile." That's not in the rules. And that's fine. But in a game like this, you can come up with any plans you want to. In that way the game is like a real world, and the people in it are like real people. Nobody minds too much if you go around smashing pottery and looting houses in a video game, but in this game, that sort of thing has real consequences. Similarly, you can't lure Bowser out of his castle with a delicious meal in the video game because cooking wasn't coded into the game.

Coming up with a good plan and executing that plan is important. Be smart. Pay attention. Think of solutions that the rules don't cover.

**In Character vs Out of Character**: You don't have to do silly voices or wear costumes. You'll figure out how comfortable you are acting as your character as we go along. The main thing, right now, is to remember that your character knows things you don't know, and that you know things your character doesn't know.

Your character knows things about the world that you, as a player, don't know. They know how to ride a horse or make poison or identify magic runes. If there's a situation where that applies, I'll just tell you what your character knows. If I'm not sure, I might make you roll for it.

Similarly, there are things you know that your characters don't know. The main one is reason. We live in a logical age; the characters you're playing don't. They don't have the benefit of a post-Enlightenment education. They might not even be literate. You aren't afraid of the weather because you understand what weather is. Your characters don't. They might not understand things that we take for granted, and they might act on motives that we'd find archaic or ridiculous.

You, the player, might know things about other characters or the world that your character doesn't. You might know a secret about another character's past, or the best way to kill a vampire. But remember, your character can only act on knowledge they have in the game.We'll discuss this more as it comes up.

**Your characters are going to die.**: Did you ever play Super Mario Bros? Mario died a lot in that game. Sometimes he died because you made a mistake. Sometimes it was chance, or luck, or you were distracted, or you didn't understand how an enemy worked. This game is like that, except in the video game, Mario comes back again and again. In this game, each time you get a new character.

Having a character die doesn't mean you made a mistake or failed. It's part of the learning process. Sometimes it's just random chance.

You get to make a new character, and I'll find a way to introduce them to the group. You start at Level 1 again but it's not a big deal. A Level 1 character is just as useful as a Level 4 character almost every way. You'll never be completely outclassed.

**Leveling**: You level up and improve your character by looting treasure. Imagine a dragon and its hoard. Kill the dragon and you get 0 XP. Steal the treasure, by force or stealth, and it counts. You have to get it out of the dungeon and take it somewhere safe, but once it's safe - buried, spent, invested, or donated - it counts.

**The Social Contract**: If you like this game and you're having fun, show up on time, or tell me in advance if you can't make it. If you don't like this game, let me know and we'll make changes. If anything about this game makes you uncomfortable, bring it up immediately. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, or it only occurs to you later, you can always email me.

Please don't bring out your phones during game unless there's something urgent. Ideally this is the most interesting thing going on. In the same vein, understand that there are 5 other people in the room, so don't deliberately waste time.

The setting of this game is semi-medieval. That means that terrible things happen on a regular basis. It would feel like I was whitewashing or disneyfying the past if I said that this setting doesn't include things like misogyny, racism, sexual violence, etc. These things happen in the real world. It'd be strange to have a fictional world without them. That being said, they won't form a major part of this game.

Gender is also much more important in this game than it is in the modern world, but possibly less important than you might fear. At the very high end of society, you can get away with breaking gender norms by wealth, power, law, and ability. At the very low end, nobody cares. It's only the middle classes and the Church who obsess over propriety and station. It probably won't be an important part of most sessions.

**The Rules**: Are always available for you to read. They aren't secret. If you find inconsistencies or errors, let me know, but the rules aren't the law. As the GM, what I say goes, and if need be, what I say, went. If you think you've found a loophole, but the results of that loophole don't make any sense, it will stop working immediately.

**Questions**: If you have questions, let me know. Some example questions include:

- "Can I hit him with an arrow at this distance?"
- "What does X taste like?"
- "Does my character know anything about X?"
- "How much damage does a longsword do if I throw it at someone?"

Before we start, do you have any questions right now?

# Character Generation

1. Choose or roll for your **Race**. Your character’s Race will grant them a Perk, a Drawback, and one Stat they can reroll.
2. Roll your **Stats**. 3d6 in order. You may reroll the Stat given by your Race and pick the higher result.
3. Choose or roll for your **Class**. Gain the first template (A) and any other items and bonuses.
4. Roll for any skills or items requested by your class.
5. Gain 1d10cp. If the entire group is level 1, all PCs also gain a blanket (1 slot) and 3 rations (1 slot).

## The Base Adventurer

A newly created PC without any class templates is expected to be reasonably competent in most areas but not specialized in any one direction. The GLOG is not about classes. Classes are just a set of extra tools to do things. Classes are significantly less important than What You Do Around The Table.

### Ultra-Core Classes

The basic, balanced, and entirely sensible classes. Suitable for new players, uncertain players, or small groups.

- Fighter, Thief, and Wizard (Orthodox).

### Core Classes

The nine classes listed here have been tested in multiple combinations and function reasonably well.

- Fighter, Barbarian, Knight.
- Thief, Hunter, Monk.
- Wizard, Sorcerer, Summoner.

### Novelty Classes

The classes listed here require unusual playstyles, GM adjudication, or a specific kind of setting.

- Cannoneer
- Exorcist
- Inventor Necromancer
- Goblin
- Many Goblins
- Paladin of the Word

### Extra

Extra classes cannot be taken as a first template. They are odd, obscure, and strange. Adapt them if someone wants to level as a Vampire or something.

- Surly Gnome
- Cannibal Gourmet

## Templates & Multiclassing

Each class has 4 Templates. Templates are gained sequentially (A, then B, then C, then D). To multiclass, simply pick the lowest template from another class. E.g. A level 4 character could pick Fighter A, Wizard A, Monk A, and Fighter B.

Multiclassing should make sense. Multiclassing for optimization or mechanical reasons should be strongly discouraged by the GM. The game is not about the mechanics or having the biggest numbers. Bigger numbers will not save you.

### Levelling Up

PCs gain experience points (XP) by looting stuff. Wages don’t count. The loot must be taken to a place of safety and divided or assigned to the PCs to become XP. Items or equipment used by the characters and not sold don’t count for XP purposes. Players should track a PC’s XP (the total amount of treasure they have accumulated) along with their current cash. Purely frivolous spending converts 10% of the money spent into XP.

Whenever a PC levels, increase their HP, Attack, and base Save (before their Charisma bonus is added). A PC can also test to improve a stat of their choice. Declare the stat and roll 3d6. If the result is over, the stat’s value increases by 1.

| Level | XP    | HP (20 Max) | Class Templates | Attack | Base Save |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- | --------------- | ------ | --------- |
| 1     | -     | Con - 4     | 1               | 11     | 6         |
| 2     | 200   | Con - 2     | 2               | 12     | 7         |
| 3     | 400   | Con         | 3               | 12     | 7         |
| 4     | 700   | Con + 2     | 4               | 13     | 7         |
| 5     | 1,000 | Con + 4     | -               | 13     | 8         |
| 6     | 1,400 | Con + 6     | -               | 14     | 8         |
| 7     | 1,800 | Con + 7     | -               | 14     | 8         |
| 8     | 2,200 | Con + 8     | -               | 15     | 9         |
| 9     | 2,600 | Con + 9     | -               | 15     | 9         |
| 10    | 3,000 | Con + 10    | -               | 15     | 10        |
| +1    | +500  | +1          | -               | 15     | 10        |

At Level 5, and every time a PC levels up past Level 5, they can retire to safety. The GM cannot torment them anymore. If they can afford it, they can buy some land, set up a shop, teach at a wizard college, or beg in the gutter. At Level 10 and beyond, a PC who dies can fight death. If they succeed, they can return to life. All future Saves to avoid death will be at a penalty, but they gain a second chance.

| Stat  | Bonus | Stat     | Bonus | Stat     | Bonus |
| ----- | ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| 1,2   | -3    | 9,10,11  | 0     | 18,19,20 | 3     |
| 3,4,5 | -2    | 12,13,14 | 1     | 21,22,23 | 4     |

# Magic

### The Magic System in a Nutshell

You get one spell slot per level that can hold a single spell. You prepare these in the morning.

You get one casting die per level that can be used to cast a spell. These are refreshed by a good night's sleep.

You cast by investing your casting dice in a spell and then rolling them. The more dice, the stronger the spell. Each die that you invest has a 50% chance of being refunded back into your casting pool.

### What is a Spell?

Spells are extra-dimensional creatures. Wizards use them like items, or ammunition.

All spells are sentient. They are made up of sentience in the same way that we are made up of matter.

When isolated away from a wizard's brain, spells are also called spirits, angels, or demons. (Every demon is a spell, and every spell a demon. These distinctions are a matter of application, rather than substance.) Spells are just weaponized spirits.

### Where do Spirits Live?

Spirits live all around us, in the Ethereal plane, an invisible dimension that overlaps with our own.

Sometimes, very rarely, a spirit will be bound in a book, or in a wizard's brain. This is what turns a spirit into a spell. (It is the act of comprehension that traps the spirit; to understand a spirit is to cage it.)

Once a spell is captured, it can be used. The wizard uses their own sentience (casting dice) to goad the spell into action. Spellcasting is not so different from tugging on the reins, or digging in with your spurs.

The number of spells that can fit in a wizard's brain (spell slots) is limited by their ability to flex their brains into mindscapes that better accommodate the spell they wish to lure into their brain-trap. It is not knowledge that achieves this, but rather visualization and self-delusion.

### Scrolls and Spellbooks

When a wizard has too many spells that can be stored in their brains, they place the excess spells in scrolls. Scrolls are the ammo boxes, wizard brains are the guns.

Scrolls are functional identically to spellbooks. The only difference is that spellbooks occupy a single inventory slot and can hold 10 spells, while a scroll can only hold one spell, and up to three of them can be bundled into one inventory slot. Spellbooks are also protected by waterproof bags and metal covers, while scrolls can be damaged beyond usability. (Whenever you take fire or acid damage, each scroll you are carrying has a 50% chance of being destroyed.)

### Identifying Magic Items

If you have at least one level in a spellcasting class, you can attempt to understand magical items.

One round of close examination (touching, sniffing) allows you to tell if an item is magical or not. 10 minutes of close examination allows you to make an Intelligence check to learn more about it.

For example, if the item in question is a scroll, you successfully identify the spell contained on it. If you are using a wizarding laboratory (cost: 5,000c) you will always successfully identify the item.

Potions never tell you anything beyond “I'm a potion.” Their effects must be determined experimentally: tiny sips of a potion usually give clues to their identity.

Sometimes items have properties that can't be identified in the field. They require a wizarding library or some scrap of lore. The most powerful artifacts usually require additional work to decipher their latent abilities, and cursed items usually hide their curses, but in both of these cases you will get a sense that there is more to learn after identifying it.

If you fail to identify a magical item, you cannot try again until you have had a chance to visit a library containing books on magic.

Sages also exist, who can identify magic items for a fee. Sages usually have a 60% success rate, or a 90% success rate if the item pertains to a specialty of theirs. Most sages charge 100c per item identified.

### Moving Spells Around

Spells can be moved from one scroll (or spellbook) to another with an hour of work, performed by someone who has deciphered it. Wizards are assumed to be carrying the minor inks required, but blank scrolls and spellbooks must be purchased separately. (And in a pinch, any method of writing will suffice: blood, feces, scratches, pinhole patterns, braided knots, and teacup arrangement codes can all be used to store a spell).

Remember that spells cannot be copied, merely moved.

A wizard can move a spell into his brain via memorization. (This is not actual memorization; it's more like luring a spell into your head by disguising your thoughts.) One hour of study allows a wizard to swap around any number of spells between his brain and scrolls. You can leave blank spots, if you wish. A scroll must be understood before it can be memorized.

If a wizard dies while spells are still stored in his brain, the spells remain. They do not return to the now-blank scrolls.

It is possible to learn spells from a dead wizard. It involves bisecting the wizard's skull and balancing it atop a golden needle. The memorization of spells causes the brain to carve grooves on the inside of the skull, and the skull now moves over these grooves like an Ouija board. With a compass, water clock, and brain almanac, these movements can be deciphered. This device is called a cerebreus (sarah- BRAY-us), and it is part of a wizarding laboratory.

### Spell Slots

A wizard uses their spell slots to memorize their spells. A wizard has one spell slot for each level of caster that they possess, up to a maximum of four spell slots at level 4. If you have a spell in one of your spell slots, you can cast it spontaneously.

### Casting Pool

Each level of a spellcasting class gives you a casting die, up to a maximum of four casting dice at level 4.

So a level 5 wizard would have 4 spell slots (each holding one spell) and 4 casting dice.

### Casting a Spell from a Scroll

It's usually a good idea to identify a scroll before you try to cast it.

If a scroll is unidentified, anyone can cast from it with a successful Int check. If they fail this Int check, the spell fizzles (it is wasted) and you make another Int check. If you fail this second Int check, you suffer a Mishap. The mishap is from your own Mishap list if you are a spellcaster, or from the Orthodox Wizard Mishap List if you are not a spellcaster.

If you successfully cast a spell without knowing what it does, the DM will ask you “what are you casting it on?”. She will consider the requirements of the spell (range, eligible targets, etc) and attempt to interpret your target choice as best as possible.

Once a scroll has been identified, anyone who understands it can cast it safely. It's even possible for a wizard to identify a scroll, show the party's Int 7 fighter how to cast the spell, and then watch the fighter cast the scroll successfully.

If you successfully cast a spell from a scroll, the scroll is destroyed by the casting. However, this destruction invests one free casting die into the spell. (This is how the fighter can cast a spell, even without having any casting dice of his own.)

If you have additional casting dice of your own, you can add them on top of the free casting die the scroll provided. Roll the dice together, since Mishaps and Dooms are still possible, but make sure that you casting dice are a different color than the scroll's casting dice, since your invested dice are refunded if they show 1-3, while the scroll's die is always spent.

Example: a level 2 wizard has two casting dice, and then casts fireball from a scroll. As the scroll crumbles to ashes in her hands, she decides to invest both of her casting dice, in order to make the spell as powerful as possible. The scroll's casting die comes up 3, while her dice up as 3 and 6. The fireball does 12 damage (3 + 3 + 6) and she suffers the effects of a Mishap. She is refunded one of her invested dice, since it rolled a 3 or less, while the die that rolled a 6 is exhausted until tomorrow.

### Casting a Spell From Memory

Step 1: Pick one of the spells you have memorized.

Step 2: Chose how many casting dice you want to invest in the spell, and remove them from your casting pool.

Step 3: Roll however the invested dice. The spell takes effect.

Step 4: Dice that show a result of 1-3 are returned to your casting pool

The more casting dice you roll, the more powerful the spell. Some spells have an effect based on the total number of dice you roll (listed as [dice] in spell descriptions) while others have an effect based on the sum of those dice (listed as [sum] in spell descriptions).

However, the more casting dice you roll, the greater the chance for mishaps and doom.

If you roll doubles on your casting dice, you have incurred a mishap—a small negative magical effect that spilled out of the Ether due to the spell's contortions. If you roll triples, you have incurred a Doom: a creeping threat that will eventually destroy you.

### Mishaps

When you suffer a Mishap, look up your school of magic and roll on the Mishap table. Most of them aren't too bad. A mishap takes effect immediately.

### Dooms

Every apprentice knows that if they travel down the road of wizardry long enough, their doom will eventually claim them. It waits at the end of every wizard's career.

Each school of magic has different Dooms.

The first time you roll triples, you suffer your first Doom.

The second time you roll triples, you suffer your second Doom.

The third time you roll triples, you suffer your third and final Doom.

While your first and second Dooms tend to be survivable, your final Doom usually spells the end of your career (usually through your death).

There are three ways to avoid your Doom.

- Never use more than two casting dice at a time, forever limiting your magical power.
- Seek out a solution to your Doom. These are always unique quests that your DM designs for you. They are usually pretty epic.
- Become a warlock.

### Casting a Prepared Spell

You have a number of casting dice equal to the number of levels you have in casting classes. Each casting die is a d6.

When you want to cast a spell, pick a prepared spell, choose how many casting dice you want to invest in it, and then roll those dice.

Every casting die that comes up 1-3 returns to your casting dice pool. Every die that comes up 4-6 is exhausted, and only returns to your casting dice pool after a good night's sleep. Once your casting dice pool is empty, you cannot cast any more spells that day.

The higher the sum of your casting dice, the more effective the spell. For example, the damage that a fireball spell does is equal to the sum of your casting dice. [sum] = sum of casting dice.

For other spells, it is only the sum of the dice that matters. For example, knock opens one portal for every casting die invested. [dice] = number of casting dice.

It is possible to prepare to a spell from a scroll, exactly as if from a spellbook. If the scroll is destroyed while the spell is still in your head, you cannot remove the scroll without losing it permanently (since the spell has no home to go back to). You'll need to scribe it onto a new scroll, in a process that takes an hour.

### Magic Robes

Wizards can wear armor without penalty. However, if they wear a magic robe, they get +1 casting dice, beginning in the morning when they wake up in the robe, and lasting until they remove it.

Anyone can wear a magic robe to get +1 casting die, even the Int 7 fighter. However, the fighter still cannot cast spells since they have no spells memorized (that requires spell slots).

### Magic Wands

A wand lets you cast a spell without having it memorized. It is essentially another spell slot with a fixed spell inside it.

If the Int 7 fighter wears a magic robe AND wields a magic wand, they can cast spells because they have a casting die (from the robe) and a spell (from the wand's spell slot).

### Magic Staves

There are all sorts of staves, and most of them are some variation of the wand. Most give you the ability to cast a new spell, and then bonuses if you can actually manage to cast that spell independently.

For example, the Briar Staff allows you to cast entangle but if you cast entangle without using the staff, the staff allows you to teleport to anywhere within 50' as long as you enter and exit a plant.

For now, most GLOG-hack esque classes can be used.
