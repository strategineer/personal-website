# Intro

The default X-Mooks setting is Glogea (glow-gee-aaa). What follows are some notes on parts of it. They are far from exhaustive.

I plan on starting small, combining this setting with existing OSR modules and building things out on the fly. I want to focus on what's different/cool instead of regurgitating what's the same/boring.

# Core

What makes Glogea special compared to your generic fantasy setting? In Glogea, every being, humanoid or otherwise, is born with latent magical power of a particular kind (fire, time, gravity, esper, etc.) that always visibly manifest in some way on the being (whether through a physical appearance thing, a guardian spirit, a familiar or something else).

Most beings never access this power, but through study, guidance and/or luck a select few beings will manage to access their power.

The more powerful a being's power is the more visually distinct its manifestation is. It may also have effects on the being's behavior, their mind and their perception of the world around them.

# Magic

Spells are creatures that can be convinced to join your cause, think Pok√©mon.

When you're born, you're bound to a spell semi-permanently (there's always exceptions), called an innate spell, think X Men but with magic.

Innate spells manifest visually:

- on your body (burning hand, translucent skin, etc.), think Fallout mutations.
- Or as a spiritual aura that surrounds you, think Jo-Jo.
- Or as a familiar that follows you around, think His Dark Materials.

Your innate spell contributes to your initial position in society. However, innate spells are not 100% known at birth, until the caster casts them the first time, if ever.

Depending on the society, attempts are made to put people in places where they will be of most utility for the greater good, or profit for the local Baron or slave owner.

Innate spells can be nurtured, powered up or be changed through various means.

Innate spells can be stolen, think Heroes, but this is rare.

Spells can be gained but this requires divine intervention, the use of ancient artifacts or intense studying or journeying to the spell realm where all spells reside.

Your innate spell may influence your personality, at least that's what people believe.

# People

Humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, a variety of humanoid animals all co-exist in Golgea. 

Sentient beings of all kinds are common in Golgea, some don't get along, some do, but this is usually a matter of context and circumstance rather than racial hatred.

There is a distinct lack of mindless "evil" humanoids in Golgea. Humanoid beings that are truly evil, can't be reasoned with and will fight to the death unless given no other choice are very rare. Exceptions for this are death cultists, the mindless undead (undead necromancers, vampires and the like excluded) and primordial evil beings from a time before Time (don't ask). 

# Places

## Korgath

An ethno-state ruled by human fascists. Most believe that humans, of any skin color or creed, are above animal humanoids and treat them in best cases with comtempt in worst cases violently.

If animal humanoids are unlucky enough to find themselves within Korgish lands, they will soon find themselves without whether they like it or not.

Considered as a threat by most of its neighbours, however the Korgish state tends to keep to itself. Controls a large landmass with abundant natural resources that are exported to neighboring lands.

Kargish dissidents who oppose the Kargish's states discriminatory policies exist and have been looking to overthrow the existing government but require the support of powerful allies to do so.

### Hooks

- Kargish dissidents are looking for support to overthrow their fascist government, a neighboring nation could supply the manpower and resources needed to do so.

## The Hearth

A neutral meeting ground in the center of Golgea, serves as a trading hub and acts as the home of Golgea's Merchant Guild.

Anyone who is willing to buy, sell or work to help others do either, is allowed to stay at the Hearth, others are shunned.

The Hearth, and its merchant guild, is hierarchical. One's position in society is determined by the value they bring to the Hearth through trading or helping trades occur. A rigid system of bureaucrats and accountants work diligently to keep track of everyone's contributions.

It's in the interest of most to help with this process but some seek to subvert it for their own gains. The Merchant Guild harshly punishes those who are caught by its network of auditors. But the interconnectedness of merchants and their relationships with each other discourages most from snitching on each other.

The Hearth pays all its functionaries using the funds gained through the minor transaction fee applied to each trade.

The Hearth pays for a standing army of mercenaries to prevent theft and trade-related activities. 

### Hooks

- The Hearth's auditors are looking for scrupulous individuals to infiltrate a local merchant's operation to suss out any funny business.
- The Prospectors's Guild is always looking for new recruits to provide with the location of nearby ruins and dungeons and some basic prospecting gear on loan in exchange for a cut off the profits.


## The Kingdom of Arathea

A land of green fields, hills and forests, welcoming to all but particularly humanoid animal hybrids led by Aldeus, a lionling, with great power.

In Arathea, it is said that Aldeus was born with the innate magical power granting him the ability to control celestial objects. Aldeus is said to be able to bring meteors to the ground, move stars, and slow the rotation of Golgea, among other things. No rival nation has been desperate enough to put this to the test.

Aldeus is worshipped like a god, some say he might even be one.

Some Aratheans doubt the state's claims about Aldeus's power, however they must do so in secret, lest they be found out by the Vigilees, a group of elite soldiers with psychic powers trained to keep the Arathean's state safe from within and without.

In other lands, there are rumors that Aldeus is the latest product of generations of experimentation and selective breeding done by the Arethean state to create more than just a leader, but a weapon to wield.

The Arathean state exerts power and control throughout the land by delegating local issues to local leaders, usually wizards.

### Hooks

- The extent of Aldeus's powers are unclear, any concrete evidence to support or contradict claims about his powers would be very valuable for interested parties.

## The Glade of the Elves

As you can imagine, Elven lands, open to outsiders.

## The Barrows

A marshland settled by an old race  with the neurtal



# Creation Myth

There were four titanic beasts, blood brothers birthed from the womb of Time itself, fought each other to the death. Only one of the brothers remained, known as Angolastra, having received fatal wounds from the battle died.

Time wept upon his corpse and, in doing so, created the world as we know it today.

# Religion

The people of Golgea believe in a wide variety faiths, described below are a few of the larger ones. But Golgea has too many powerful spirits to worship and prophets to follow to list here.

## Aratheaism

See [Arathea](#the-kingdom-of-arathea).

Arathean missionaries travel to lands near and far to establish churches and proseletyse the greatness of Aldeus.

## The Wheeled Ones

To become a Wheeled One, one must forgo ever staying in the same place for long and ownership of anything that one cannot carry on their backs. Pilgrims through and through, The Wheeled Ones believe that it is only through regular travel that one can discover the truth about themselves, the world around them and the reality that underpins everything.

Seekers of truth and knowledge, the Wheeled Ones can usually be expected to tell the truth, as they understand it. Newer adepts may be innocent and ignorant, however experienced Wheeled Ones have lived a long life of wandering that usually leads them down a path to great wisdom and down-to-earth experience.

The Wheeled Ones do not worship a deity per-say but a one-ness with all things. Being a Wheeled One is less of a faith and more of a lifestyle.

Solitary travel is encouraged but choosing to travel with a group is not frowned upon. Generally, The Wheeled Ones do not exclude members from their faith.

The Wheeled Ones don't have a hierarchy of any kind.

You may find Wheeled Ones working as caravan guards, guides, hunters, trackers and couriers. They favor short term engagements allowing them a certain level of freedom of movement to go where they please. Most experienced Wheeled Ones no matter the environment are knowledgeable enough to subsist on local fauna and flora.

Wheeled Ones can often be found resting on the side of the road, praying at any roadside altar.


Experienced Wheeled Ones tell great stories and ask great questions.
