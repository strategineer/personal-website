# Intro

Labor focused satire theme, players can choose their mission after their initial tutorial intro sequence and briefing

# Tutorial
PCs begin play in a small private viewing room, dark unlit, strapped in to their seats watching a series of instructional videos telling them some of what they need to know to succeed at being troubleshooter.

{{< quote >}}
You find yourselves in the Alpha Complex. It's something like Portal's Aperture Science Facility but instead of an underground facility for just doing science, it's supposed to be a completely enclosed ecosystem/world.

The facility is managed by an all-seeing Computer (The Computer), think Glados but more british.

You are playing as new troubleshooters, it's your first day on the job. A troubleshooter's role is to deal with any problems that come up in the Alpha Complex. As players, you know that the Alpha Complex is falling apart and in a constant state of disrepair. The Computer is no longer capable of maintaining the facility and it doesn't understand why. The Computer has ratched up the surveillance state and blames everyone but itself for the Alpha Complex's problems.

Colonel Kernel (old haggard military man, white hair, beret, yellow clearance) enters the room, salutes the group of newly minted troubleshooters, gives the players their iLiveToServe device, gives minimal hints and leaves room for questions.

Players are given the illusion of choice and presented with three missions through their service device (they can only pick one), players go to R&D department and meet Jefferson, the R&D technician, who assigns everyone on major tool but they aren't allowed to test out their equipmennt before they're in the field. Jefferson will ask them to report back to R&D HQ with their in-field testing results.

# Mission

## Main Mission

A bit of a "dungeon crawl" in the soy sauce factory and adjacent buildings in District NOOB.

Players enter through the Main lobby at 4.

Factions:

- Factory Workers: Infrared level humanoid workers who are managerial staff.
- Cockroach revolutionaries: bio-engineered cockroaches who are subservient to the human factory workers who both: work in the factory AND are the input product of the factory itself. Sentient giant cockroaches are turning other sentient giant cockroaches into soy sauce (or something that looks and tastes like it).
- Robot maintenance and security workforce: They clean, they protect the factory from bad actors and their programming has been messed with by the Cockroach revolutionaries so they're behavior is erratic.

## Extra Ideas
- Bug infestation in the soy sauce factory, the bugs bleed soy sauce? Actually it's a revolt by the bugs who are tired of being squeezed for their juice.
- Which leads the troubleshooters to the nearest laundromat
- Sentient laundry machine tries to launder people. 
- Which leads the troubleshooters on a goose chase all over the city to find previously non sentient machines becoming sentient and filled with rage
- A particular brand of companion robot all across the alpha complex needs to be recalled,  they won't come willingly. Glojob123, fluorescent sex robots that do everything to advertise their services (NB: They kill their clients).
