# Stuff

MONOLOGUE: When you give an impassioned ethical, political, or philosophical speech, roll +CREATIVE. On a partial success, you engage your target in the melodramatic speech, temporarily distracting them. On a full success, they see your line of reasoning and make an effort to join your school of thought. Ƭ Yorick’s skull prop (very realistic), +2 CREATIVE

As long as you are alive, your remaining MAX HP is divided as evenly as possible and added onto the MAX HP of every other player (e.g. a 6 MAX HP MASCOT in a four-player team grants 1, 2, and 2 MAX HP to the other three players).

Lower-class people will never trust you, and you struggle to hide the sticky psychic stench of wealth.
