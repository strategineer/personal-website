{{< rpg_table name="WeaponTag" hide_table=true >}}
| Weapon Tag |
| --- |
| ACCURATE: Scoped, sighted, or well-balanced; this weapon grants one automatic success when attacking per mission. |
| ANTI-MATERIEL: Deals double DAMAGE to vehicles and structures; cumbersome to carry around. |
| ALT-FIRE: This weapon has a secondary component or form which also deals damage, (e.g. bayonet, launcher attachment, sword that becomes a whip). |
| ARMOR-PIERCING: Attacks with this weapon ignore ARMOR bonuses granted by physical means. |
| BANE: Forged from (or fires) a magically useful material of your choice (silver, salt, etc.) Deals double DAMAGE to those affected. |
| COLLAPSIBLE: Easily concealed, no matter the size; will never be detected during pat-downs. |
| CURSED: Requires powerful magic to remove once equipped. The wielder may permanently spend 1D6 MAX HP to guarantee a successful attack. |
| CUSTOMIZED: Deals an additional 1 DAMAGE and has a weapon skin (p. 141); coveted by enemies. |
| DUMMY: Appears to be a weapon, but is actually another mundane item of your choice (e.g. gun lighter, fake sword with a hidden compartment). |
| ELECTRIFIED: Deals double DAMAGE to robots and other complex machines. Shorts out running electronics and briefly electrifies bodies of water. |
| EXPERIMENTAL: When each mission begins, roll D66 on this table for the weapon’s effect (if you get EXPERIMENTAL, create a new one with the ref). |
| FLASHY: If you describe a unique and bombastic attack with this weapon, you can roll +CREATIVE to hit. |
| GRIP: Custom materials and ergonomic design; the referee can never state that you drop this weapon. |
| HEAVY: This thing is too big to be called a weapon. Once per mission, take +3 on a FORCEFUL roll that involves this weapon. |
| HUD: Scans hostiles. When you kill something new, the referee will tell you a useful fact about it. |
| ICE: Makes surfaces slick and deals double DAMAGE to anything that requires warmth to function. |
| INCENDIARY: When damage is dealt, this weapon also deals 2 DAMAGE to anything within fire- spreading range. Deals double DAMAGE to plants. |
| INDESTRUCTIBLE: Impervious to everything; can withstand any amount of pressure or corrosion. |
| LIGHT: Weighs almost nothing. Grants +1 on REFLEXIVE rolls that involve this weapon. |
| LOUD: Attacks with this weapon draw the undivided attention of enemies within earshot (and instantly reveal your position). |
| LUCKY: Rolling an ultra success while attacking with this weapon grants the user one WAR DIE. |
| MEDICAL: Once per mission, you may use this weapon to deal negative DAMAGE, healing the target. |
| MESSY: Enemies explode into gore/goo/scrap etc. on ultra successes (in addition to the usual bonus). No identifiers will remain—not even teeth. |
| MENACING: Enemies who see a comrade slain by this weapon have a 1-in-1D6 chance to flee. |
| NON-LETHAL: Does not deal DAMAGE; has a 3-in-1D6 chance to knock unconscious on a success. |
| POISONED: When you would roll for damage for this weapon, wait and mark your target as poisoned instead. Next time they’re hurt, roll your DAMAGE and add it to the total amount they take. |
| PROTOTYPE: Wielding this next-generation weapon grants +1 TACTICAL; roll +TAC to attack with it. |
| QUICK-DRAW: Attacks that target enemies drawing their weapons will always succeed. |
| REMOTE: Projectiles (or the weapon itself) can be remotely steered through chutes and around walls. |
| RITUAL: Shatters to protect you from death once, negating lethal damage. Disintegrates afterward. |
| SAPIENT: Communicates with its wielder by thought; roll 1D6 for disposition: bloodthirsty, caring, craven, excitable, morose, stoic. |
| SHREDDER: Deals double DAMAGE to exposed flesh. On critical hits, decreases the target’s ARMOR by 1. |
| STUN: Those damaged by this weapon cannot move or act until their current HP changes. |
| TRANQUILIZER: As NON-LETHAL, but chance is increased to 5-in-1D6 if a vulnerable area is specifically targeted (e.g. head, neck, exposed membrane, etc.) |
| UNSTABLE: Can be set to overload to deal triple DAMAGE once; explodes for 3D6 damage to everyone nearby seconds later. |
| VALUABLE: Utterly unique in history or make. Can be used as a bargaining chip in almost any situation. |

{{< rpg_table name="CyclopsGadget" weighted=true hide_table=true >}}
| ... | Gadget | Description |
| ---  | ---  | --- |
| 2.78  | Anti-mnemonic syringe | The anti-mnemonic syringe can easily be mistaken for an oddly dense steel ballpoint pen. When used on a major artery, the victim's bloodstream is flooded with a chemical compound that induces a several hour blackout, followed by general amnesia. The syringe is wondrously effective for memory wipes, leaving the afflicted with no recollection of the past day and a feeling of “lost time." |
| 5.56  | Appearance scrambler | CYCLOPS employs compact, belt-mounted appearance scramblers to hide obviously ultrahuman operatives. Push a button and the scrambler will project a combination hologram-psionic shell which fools onlookers into perceiving an unremarkable civilian. The scrambler is thorough down to the user’s voice and mannerisms, but cannot simulate any existing person due to quantum interference. The holographic shell has only 3 HP and takes DAMAGE alongside the user, so the device must remain well-protected for its entire 12-hour battery life. |
| 8.33  | Comms wire | Most CROs communicate with their team using state of the art, credit card-sized transistor radios tucked away in a pocket or strapped to strategic points along the torso and limbs. These radios are unlike anything available on the consumer market, allowing for simultaneous two- way communication and multi-user “conference calls.” Instead of a microphone and speaker, CYCLOPS has developed a rubberized flesh-toned wire with a micro- motor tip for vibrating in- and out-going audio through the wearer’s cartilage. |
| 11.11 | Containment pylons | One CYCLOPS containment kit includes three telescoping black pylons (ten inches long collapsed and about five feet tall with spring-loaded tripod feet when extended) and a two-button remote which fits in the user’s palm. When the pylons are placed in a triangle and activated, a pyramid-shaped forcefield (6 ARMOR, 40 HP) forms between them. The containment pylons nullify most of the movement-based abilities known to CYCLOPS, have a maximum volume roughly equal to a gymnasium, and can be switched to “neutralize,” turning the forcefield bright red and dealing 6D6 DAMAGE to anything inside. |
| 13.89 | False death implant The false death implant is a time-honored trick: a molar- implanted pill which, when ingested, perfectly simulates death (in fact cadaverous sleep) for twenty-four hours. |
| 16.67 | Dynamic ID | Dynamic IDs are blank plastic ID cards mass produced by captive magicians, outfitted with a simple glamour that responds to the user's whims. The glamour will show a set of believable credentials to anyone who isn't looking too closely. All CYCLOPS personnel, even desk jockeys and janitors, are trained early on to spot dynamic IDs. |
| 13.89 | Fingerprint neutralizer | Although CYCLOPS has at least indirect control over all law enforcement agencies, covering one's tracks is still a constant concern. The fingerprint neutralizer is a bulky, pistol-shaped device which projects a short-range cone of sebum-disturbing sonic vibration. Once used, prints on any surface become distorted and illegible. |
| 11.11 | Dissolving ammunition | For high-profile assassinations or missions which require leaving no trace of an agent's presence, CYCLOPS uses proprietary “dissolving ammunition" which contains a strain of specially-cultivated alien bacteria capable of rapidly metabolizing lead (as well as flesh, to a certain extent—dissolving ammo deals an additional 1 DAMAGE). Dissolving ammo is a finite resource, so you should either track your shots directly (dissolving ammo clips have 6 shots), or use the abstract ammo tracking rules (p. 73). |
| 8.33  | Portable fusion generator | Despite the ensuing stable time loop, CYCLOPS Command has deemed their decision to build miniaturized cold fusion reactors based upon their own blueprints from the distant future “an acceptable risk." The briefcase- sized generator can supply a city grid's worth of power for 24 hours—if pushed beyond this point, it will erupt in a small nuclear explosion which deals 10D6 DAMAGE. |
| 5.56  | Teleporter relay | The chest-mounted teleporter relay instantly transports the user to the nearest CYCLOPS facility when the cord is pulled. CYCLOPS has no way to identify who is using a relay until target-site atomic reconstruction is complete, which can lead to major confusion if the incoming user turns out to be an enemy operative. |
| 2.78  | Thought disruptor | Also frequently referred to as a “Schrödinger disruptor" in official documentation, the thought disruptor is used when the outcome of a quantum event needs to be changed. The disruptor self-destructs upon use and renders a target temporarily unable to perceive anything. |

{{< rpg_table name="BaseUpgrade" hide_table=true >}}
|  Base Upgrade |
| --- |
| 1. BACKUP: FIST gets a backup squad of mercenaries who can be sent on missions in lieu of the players. This squad (p. 106) has a collective score of 0 in FRC, TAC, CRE, and RFX. This upgrade can be taken again to increase any squad attribute by 1, or to add a new squad. Squads can also be brought along on player missions as referee-controlled NPCs. When the players send a backup squad on a mission, the referee should choose an attribute score to represent the mission (e.g. FRC for wiping out an enemy group, RFX for stealth infiltration) and roll for the squad's performance: TWO 1s: The squad dies or (1-in-1D6) defects. FAILURE: The mission consequence plays out. PARTIAL: Mission complete, but no reward. SUCCESS: As above, but players get the reward. TWO 6s: As above, plus +1 to any squad attribute. |
| 2. DEFENSE: FIST installs new security measures, such as squads of guards, hazards, or traps. For each DEFENSE upgrade installed, FIST may instantly kill one enemy near the upgrade during base invasions. |
| 3. EXPERT: FIST hires an on-site expert who can provide the team with additional items before the mission begins. Experts in different fields offer different items: a weaponsmith may present the team with weapon tags, a scientist may create new chemical compounds, and a doctor may provide medical supplies. FIST can get one randomized item per expert per mission, or request a specific item and wait until the next mission begins to receive it. |
| 4. OFFENSE: FIST acquires a weapon of mass destruction which can be used against a chosen target once per mission. Various weapon types are possible, but it should be something dangerous, like a bomber plane, orbital laser, or powerful ancient relic. FIST is also subject to this weapon and so must clear the area before its use, or risk being hurt as well. The weapon deals 3D6 DAMAGE by default, and taking OFFENSE again increases the DAMAGE by 1D6. |
| 5. STORAGE: FIST builds a warehouse or hangar which can be used to safely store vehicles, hide fugitives, and contain anomalies without being detected. |
| 6. SUPPORT: FIST gains a “man-in-the-chair" style support agent who can contact them throughout their missions via radio. This support agent will reveal information the players would not usually be able to access when asked, according to their area of expertise: a weapons expert can divulge enemy DAMAGE ratings, a tactician can describe boss moves before they happen, etc. Sup |

# Missions

TACTICS
: Start here. The first decision players should be able to make is how to approach the mission, and they should enter the fold in a good spot to make a game plan. You might flesh out the area around the main objective to give them a better idea of how and where it exists spatially, or draw a quick map of a building and mark multiple entrances (like a front door, back door, and loading bay). In medias res openings can also work beautifully, as long as you still include a tactical element. “How do we get out of here" is a reliable classic.

ESPIONAGE
: Even the simplest “bug hunt" missions cannot exist in a vacuum without information or connected people. Figure out where in your mission info-social-focused players could thrive, and include things for them to interact with. This could mean writing up a few NPCs with clear motivations, assets, and liabilities. It could mean infosec challenges to be overcome, like figuring out passcodes or managing how dangerous information spreads. Before you think of things to shoot at, think of things to talk about.

ACTION
: Last (but certainly not least), throw in catalyzing elements for action. Violence is the most obvious choice for action, and many players will jump at the possibility for violent action wherever it exists. The implicit threat of violence, or an imperative to avoid violence, can also be wonderful catalysts. You might deliciously complicate a mission by including a network of neural implants that lock down the entire facility if a soldier is harmed, have the players sneak past a sleeping monster, or rappel down a cliff to avoid being captured.

## Ideas

- Tonald Drump assassination
- Dead Rising-esque mall with zombies exfiltration + saving people along the way.
- Resident Evil 4 exfiltration of President's Daughter
