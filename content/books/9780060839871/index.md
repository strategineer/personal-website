Blah blah blah motorcycles blah blah.

Women shouldn't be in STEM, that's just how it is and we shouldn't fight it. 

Blah blah motorcycles blah blah blah.

Billions of people toiling their lives away day in and day out in meaningless jobs they hate is just the way it is and we shouldn't fight it. Nobody is to blame, the system is just like that and it'll never change.

Blah blah blah motorcycles blah blah.

Revolutions are pointless, the overthrown status quo will return as it once was because the status quo is deeply hierarchical, systemic and eternal. 

Blah blah motorcycles blah blah blah.

The concentration of horrible politics expressed in this book defies comprehension. Tearing it apart in the margins for the first 100 pages or so made the reading feel less like the torture that it was. But in the end, that was just about how much I could stomach.
