Comic book with characters from fairy tales like the Big Bad Wolf, Snow White and Prince Charming who've been expulsed from their lands straight into modern day New York by an evil force, called the Adversary, where they have to survive and hide their unique fairy taleness.

This comic book was first published in 2002 by a Pro-Israel author. Fables is explicitly an allegory for the Isreal-Palestenian conflict. So I'm expecting more than a little yikes with a dash of Islamophobia in this comic book so let's see how far we get.

1 volume into it so far and I'm curious to see what happens next. It's nice to read through a comic book that, so far, is much more compressed than the Berserk manga I just finished. We're not luxuriating in chapter after chapter of every single movement a guy makes as he's slicing through a horde of demons. Instead, in Fables, and American comics more broadly, we zoom in on interesting scenes and skip over the details.

There's a place for both compressed and decompressed art depicting moments in time like comic books and manga. But after reading through 41 volumes of hyper decompressed manga, I need a break!
