Eight translators travel to Poland to translate Irena Rey's next novel. Hijinks ensue.

<!--more-->

The Extinction of Irena Rey is a novel about translation, transmission, authorship, author worship, media literacy, Mycelium, *Ophiocordyceps unilateralis*, Poland, climate change, weebs and everything but the kitchen sink. I'm amazed by how much spaghetti Jennifer Croft is throwing at the wall in this novel and how much of it sticks. Even when it doesn't work, when the prose is a little too purple, it kind of still works just in a different way because of the framing of the story.

The Extinction of Irena Rey by Jennifer Croft is a frame story ([I can't get enough of them](/books/9780575069015/)) in which a woman named Alexis Archer has translated a text (peppering it with extensive footnotes) written from the perspective of one of her fellow translators in their mother tongue. This text, also named The Extinction of Irena Rey, is a personal account of the events that transpired between the author of this in-universe version of the Extinction of Irena Rey, Alexis Archer, and Irena Rey's six other translators, most of whom have known each other for over a decade, who've travelled to Poland to translate Irena Rey's latest work. Of course, hijinks ensue.

Jennifer Croft plays with this framing in interesting ways and that's what makes this novel special. I enjoyed slowly nibbling away at it while trying to integrate all the disparate ideas in the text into a cohesive whole. Getting to know the translators and how they fit into the bigger picture was enjoyable even though some of them really suck.

I don't tend to like mystery novels much. The Extinction of Irena Rey is the first mystery novel I've enjoyed without any caveats. The mystery that begins to reveal itself as you read the text is not constantly thrown in your face which I appreciated. The mystery is the kettle on the stove all these translators are swimming in and butting heads in. The mystery isn't being used as a carrot on a stick to keep the reader artificially engaged with the story [like in some novels](/books/9781473223851/).

The mystery is the story and the story is the mystery and everything about it fits nicely together and enhances the story in a meaningful way.

**Spoilers for a mystery-related beat halfway through the novel:**

{{< spoiler >}}

Around midway through the novel, after the initial setup and reveal of the core mystery, Freddie starts an uncharacteristic Detective Poirot-esque monologue where he lists out all the information and clues that the translators have gathered so far and he mentions possible further avenues for their investigation to take.

Considering the tone of the speech and Freddie being the one giving it, I interpret this as a shot being taken by Jennifer Croft at that style of mystery novel and signaling to the reader that she's trying to do something different. Why? That style of Agathie Christie-esque mystery novel is still very popular and it's been copied more times than we can count, seemingly by many authors who don't seem to understand how to bring that genre forth into the modern day in a compelling way. And, I think that Croft really is doing something different with the mystery in the Extinction of Irena Rey that hit way harder for me than other mystery novels I've read.

This novel is begging to be thought about while and after reading it. It's not perfect though, I could have lived with a few less direct author speaking to the reader about translation, but because what it's doing is so unique that elevates it above what it would have been otherwise.

Now I've got to figure out how what I'm going to do about all this spaghetti Croft has unceromoniously thrown all around my reading nook.
