Huh.

This is a weird one. I liked it a lot despite it being a little artsy-fartsy, a little navel-gazy too.

The Extinction of Irena Rey is a novel about translation, transmission, authorship, author worship, media literacy, Mycelium, *Ophiocordyceps unilateralis*, Poland, climate change, weebs and everything but the kitchen sink. I'm amazed by how much spaghetti Jennifer Croft is throwing at the wall in this novel and how much of it sticks. Even when it doesn't work, when the prose is a little too purple, I find it compelling anyway because that kind of writing still works just in a different because of the way the story is framed.

The Extinction of Irena Rey by Jennifer Croft is a frame story ([I can't get enough of them](/books/9780575069015/)) in which a woman named Alexis Archer has translated a text (peppering it throughout with extensive footnotes) written by one of her fellow translators. This text, also named The Extinction of Irena Rey, is an account of the events that transpired between Alexis Archer, and the author of this Extinction of Irena Rey (not the novel you're reading written by Jennifer Croft) and six other translators, most of whom have known each other for over a decade, who've travelled to Poland to, presumably, translate Irena Rey's latest work. Of course, hijinks ensue.

Jennifer Croft plays with this framing in interesting ways and that's what makes this novel special (and the prose is also great). I really enjoyed slowly nibbling at this novel and trying to integrate all the pieces/clues/ideas present in it into a cohesive whole which I was constantly revising during my reading.

The Extinction of Irena Rey is a mystery novel which is a genre that I don't generally like. Surprisingly, this is the first mystery novel I've really liked without any caveats. The mystery that begins to reveal itself as you read the text is not constantly thrown in your face which I appreciated ([reading Emma Newman's novel Planetfall led me to coin the term "mystery cucking"](/books/9781473223851/) to describe exactly this). The mystery is the kettle on the stove all these translators are swimming and butting heads in. The mystery isn't being used as a carrot on a stick to keep the reader artificially engaged with the story. The mystery is the story and the story is the mystery and everything about it fits nicely together and enhances the story in a meaningful way.
