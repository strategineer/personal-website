Huh.

This is a weird one. I liked it a lot despite it being a little artsy-fartsy, a little navel-gazy too.

The Extinction of Irena Rey is a novel about translation, transmission, authorship, author worship, media literacy, Mycelium, *Ophiocordyceps unilateralis*, Poland, climate change, weebs and everything but the kitchen sink. I'm amazed by how much spaghetti Jennifer Croft is throwing at the wall in this novel and how much of it sticks. Even when it doesn't work, when the prose is a little too purple for example, I find it compelling that it still works just in a different because of the way the story is framed.

The Extinction of Irena Rey by Jennifer Croft is a frame story (I can't get enough of them) in which a woman named Alexis Archer has translated a text (peppering the text with extensive footnotes throughout) by one of her fellow translators. This text, also named The Extinction of Irena Rey, is an account of the events that transpired between Alexis Archer, and the author of the Extinction of Irena Rey and six other translators, most of whom have known each other for over a decade, who've travelled to Poland to, presumably, translate Irena Rey's latest work. Of course, hijinks ensue.

Jennifer Croft plays with this framing in interesting ways and that's what makes this novel special (and the prose!). I really enjoyed slowly nibbling at this novel and trying to integrate all the pieces/clues into a cohesive whole which I was constantly revising throughout my reading.

The Extinction of Irena Rey is a mystery novel and I'd argue that it's the first one I've really liked without any caveats. The mystery that begins to reveal itself as you read through the text is not constantly thrown at your face, there's a level of subtlety with the way the mystery elements of the novel are dealt with that I appreciated.

Sometimes a reveal will be explicitely foreshadowed which influenced my reading of the story that followed but then hundreds of pages later the reveal occurs but differently than I expected and in a way that reframed my understanding of the text. There's a lot of that here which I enjoyed and didn't feel gratuitous.
