**"We're going on an adventure!"**

If you liked the previous novel in this series, Children of Time, you're likely to enjoy this one just as much if not more (I definitely did). If you haven't read it, I suggest you start with that one (also great) and then read this sequel. Otherwise, you'll be missing out.

Both novels take place in universes that feel very grounded in reality. The way in which the various species present evolve over time, communicate with each other, perceive the world around them and interact with it, feels satisfyingly plausible while simultaneously feeling truly alien.

These books put you in the shoes of wildly different characters (humans as well as very alien aliens) to tell a story spanning wide swathes of time and space.

The stories being told are enjoyable and tense romps, if that's what you're looking for. If you're interested in digging a little deeper, these stories might encourage you to explore and discuss various philosophical ideas/questions relating to consciousness, intelligence (artificial or otherwise), how are senses impact our perception of the world and thus determine how we're capable of interacting with it, and more.

When I saw that my copy of Children of Time had a quote on the front cover describing it like so: "this is really smart fiction" I cringed. But after reading it and its sequel, I think I get it now.
