It's a textbook meant to be read and discussed in the classroom but I enjoyed reading it outside of that context.

Compared to a few other psychology texts that I've read, the writing was concise and to the point. It mostly avoided repeating itself which I appreciated.

I quite enjoyed Nick Riggle's chapter on food as art because [I'm a fan of Nick Riggle's work](/books/2022-08-19/) and I'm also passionate about food.
