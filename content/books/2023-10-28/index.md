Terry Pratchett is an all-timer. The rare case of an author who is immensely popular for the right reasons.

This is a biography about him, and it's the best one we're going to get, written by the best person for the job (other than Terry Pratchett himself of course), his assistant Rob Wilkins.

It is what it says it is, the story of Terry Pratchett from the beginning to the very end.

Terry Pratchett's work speaks for itself but if you're interested in learning more about the man responsible for writing some of your favorite books, here's the perfect book for you.
