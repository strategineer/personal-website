Gene Wolfe's take on an Alice in Wonderland "rabbit hole" story set in a fantasy world based on Arthurian legend, British folklore, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, ... All at the same time... Instead of the more usual direct Tolkien inspirations.

This is something only Gene Wolfe could/would write.
