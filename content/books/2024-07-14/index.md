It's Dune. It's good. I haven't read Dune in a longtime and I'm enjoying it a lot more this time through.

<!--more-->

I feel as though I've grown as a reader and become better meeting a text where it is, understanding what it does well.

This time I'm committed to reading through Dune AND it sequel Dune Messiah which I didn't read the first time through.
