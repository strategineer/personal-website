<!--more-->

It's been interesting reading through this text and trying to see if I can apply the titular "seven basic plots" framework onto the Playstation 2 games I've been playing recently. To my surprise, they fit really well.

Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater
: Overcoming the Monster, The Quest (Rescue Sokolov, scale the mountain, infiltrate the base, etc. and "travel" to the underworld in the Sorrow fight), Voyage and Return and Rebirth?

Shadow of the Colossus
: The Quest (kill 16 colossus to revive the dead lady, "travel" to the underworld and back), Overcoming the Monster, Rebirth (post credit scene, demon baby)

Black
: Voyage and Return (time-based, frame narrative being a soldier in an interogation room telling about his recent black ops missions and the player playing through them)
