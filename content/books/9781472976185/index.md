---

In The Seven Basic Plots, Christopher Booker presents a well thought-out framework for thinking about stories, it took him 35 years to write and it shows. If you're interested in myths, fairy tales and stories more broadly, this is a must-read text, as long as you're willing to put up with a healthy serving of misogyny and bad politics throughout.
