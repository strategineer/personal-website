WOW.

Incredible.

I picked this book up after being really disappointed with [John Scalzi's The Kaiju Preservation Society](/books/9780765389121/). It's a meh novel but its poor handling of "woke" themes is particularly pathetic.

Having read [The Galaxy, and the Ground Within](/books/9781473647688/) by Becky Chambers last year and having really enjoyed it, I knew that she was interested in and skilled at telling empathetic stories about diverse people, unique and deserving of love. She tells hopeful and happy stories without shying away from "real" issues which everything in a world that I can believe in.

And yes, I made a great choice. The Long Way To A Small, Angry Planet is a fantastic novel with characters that are so alive and believable that they might as well be leaping off the page.

As soon as each character was introduced, I was so invested in their lives and their relationships with each other.

Becky Chambers excels at depicting characters, human and nonhuman alike, in a way that makes it impossible to not empathize with them. And, in doing so, she's able to create a variety of situations, from the mundane to the exciting, involving her characters and, either way, I'm at the edge of my seat.

I see aspects of myself in most of Becky Chambers's characters because they're so vibrant and fully fleshed out.

Her characters are so good, they drive the entire novel. Sure, there's a plot but the characters are at the forefront of everything that happens. The characters are the frame through which we see the entire universe of the novel and I love it.

Nothing happens in a vacuum (hehe).

This hyper focus on character is fantastic to read and you'd think more authors (*cough* John Scalzi *cough*) would be interested in writing this sort of character focused story if they could.  But I don't think it's that easy even though Becky Chambers makes it seem so.

I'm dead set on reading more of Becky Chambers's work and you can expect me to do so sooner rather than later.
