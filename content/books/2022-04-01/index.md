summary: "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat tells the stories of individuals afflicted with perceptual and intellectual disorders: patients who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people and common objects; whose limbs seem alien to them; who lack some skills yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents."

Apparently I read this a long time ago (more than a decade ago) but I forgot and I only remembered after starting to read the book again.

I read through it all again. I've always had a passing interest in psychology and this is an enjoyable popular psychology book.

The salient point this book gets across through the various case studies presented within is that our perception of the world around us is far from universal. We should embrace our differences because they make us unique; we shouldn't be ashamed of what makes us special.
