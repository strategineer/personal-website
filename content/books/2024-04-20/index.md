The 6th and final novel in Le Guin's Earthsea series.

{{< spoiler >}}

The first chapter involves a sorcerer named Alder meeting with Hawk to help him with the nightmares he's been having of the dead trying to use him to cross over into the land of the living (or something like that). Hawk helps him by giving him a cute kitten which stop Alder's night terrors until they can find a more permanent solution.

Cute and a well told story of Alder going through some shit up until the point he meets with Hawk.

So far so good, I'm about 2/3 of the way through. I really like how we're getting POVs from the main characters from throughout the Earthsea series.

Alder is a great addition to the crew, although it's unclear what he has to do with the changes happening in Earthsea.
