Ursula K. Le Guin's conclusion to her fantastic Earthsea series. Once again, she manages to create a fantasy world where violence doesn't solve everything. Her characters engage in the mundane activities that people do most of the time, chat, make friends, think about their loved ones, etc. She writes these mundane scenes yet makes them important and interesting because that's what they really are.

Hanging out with a friend or a loved one is one of the greatest things a human can do and yet how often do we see this honestly portrayed in fantasy? Yet, the Other Wind is the most "fantasy" fantasy book in the Earthsea series, featuring many tropes that you may have seen before (tropes: {{< spoiler >}}a restoration narrative think King Arthur, a mage haunted by his dark past, a king's romance with a princess from another land, a conflict occurring on the edges of the known world, etc. {{< /spoiler >}}) yet subverts or manages to make each of these tropes less tropey than they would otherwise be if written by a less competent author.

As a conclusion to the Earthsea series, it succeeds in many ways. What I love about it most is how Le Guin naturally switches between POV characters, some new and some returning from previous books in the series.

In doing so, Le Guin manages to show us the characters we've been following through their journeys so far, where they're at and where they're going as well as giving us the most comprehensive view on the inner workings of the world of Earthsea we've gotten so far.

It's a great conclusion to the series. Now that I've read the whole series I can confirm with certainty that the third book, The Farthest Shore, is not worth reading. The Other Wind feels like Le Guin's attempt to write a story like The Farthest Shore but not garbage this time hehe.

The first chapter involves a sorcerer named Alder meeting with Hawk to help him with the nightmares he's been having of the dead trying to use him to cross over into the land of the living (or something like that). Hawk helps him by giving him a cute kitten which stop Alder's night terrors until they can find a more permanent solution.

Cute and a well told story of Alder going through some shit up until the point he meets with Hawk.

So far so good, I'm about 2/3 of the way through. I really like how we're getting POVs from the main characters from throughout the Earthsea series.

Alder is a great addition to the crew, although it's unclear what he has to do with the changes happening in Earthsea.
