Voltaire's writing in Candide mostly reads like it was written yesterday, it's extremely funny and I can't believe it took me this long to read it.

One of the funniest jokes in Candide is a recurring gag where a character will mention the words "Free Will" then Voltaire will abruptly end the scene or end it with someone pouring themselves a drink.
