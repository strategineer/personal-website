You know that feeling you get when you're reading a novel and everything that's led up to this particular story beat you've just read absolutely floors you and hits you right in the feelings?

I felt that way throughout almost the entire first half of Held. Reading each section and feeling the sorrow and joys of the characters presented within. Anne Michaels is a great poet and her prose in Held feels very poetic without being poetry.

Sadly, the text loses its oomph in the last quarter and once {{< spoiler >}} Marie Curie {{< /spoiler >}} shows up I had no clue what we were doing anymore.
