---

An anthology of short stories, comics, and poems from Mexican American authors.

Initially, I was expecting to read stories from adult authors looking back on their childhood, and not kids writing about their current experiences. It's not what I expected but it's interesting so far. I hope these kids got paid.

So ya... Funnily enough, all the authors are adults, the large majority of which are middle grade and young adult fiction writers.

This explains why most of the (very) short stories are told from the perspective of children. But it doesn't explain why some of the stories feel like they were written by children.

The quality is all over the place. I'm never read an anthology before but I don't think I like it. The lack of a single voice makes for bite-sized texts that don't have a lot of space to say anything interesting.

If given the choice, I would have preferred a bunch of stories like this from one author instead of this.

The stories that really gripped me, well, I wanted them to be longer (there's only so much you can do in just a few pages). And the truly awful stories, well, I ask myself how they made their way into the anthology in the first place.
