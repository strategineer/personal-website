**spoiler alert** The Light Brigade is a story about breaking people down and putting them back together again, both mentally and physically, to turn them into perfect soldiers/monsters.

It's a wild ride that kept me hooked all throughout. It makes reference to many science fiction tropes you've seen before to keep you guessing and subverting your expectations.

Overall I enjoyed it despite the politics feeling a little on the nose (Late stage capitalism baaaad? War baaaaad? Murdering children in cold blood baaaaaad?).

If you're able to look past that and are interested in gritty off the beaten path military sci-fi, you'll probably enjoy the Light Brigade. I know I did.
