The Light Brigade is a story about breaking people down and putting them back together again, both mentally and physically, to turn them into perfect soldiers/monsters.

It's a wild ride that kept me hooked all throughout. It subverts many of the science fiction tropes you're familiar with to keep you guessing.

Overall I enjoyed it despite the politics feeling a little on the nose (Late stage capitalism baaaad? War baaaaad? Murdering children in cold blood baaaaaad?).

If you're able to look past that and are interested in gritty off the beaten path military sci-fi, you'll probably enjoy the Light Brigade. I know I did.
