title: Taoism - The Parting Of The Way

This is the book on Daoism that Ursula K. Le Guin recommends in [her rendition of the Tao Te Ching](/books/9781611807240) for anyone who reads the Tao Te Ching and wants to learn more about Daoism.

I'm about a 1/3 of my way through the text. The first Appendix got a good chuckle out of me. The text is pretty much exactly what you might expect and with Ursula K. Le Guin's seal of approval, I'm expecting the rest of it to be just as good.
