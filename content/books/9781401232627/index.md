Superhero anthology with great art. Focuses on bringing heroes down to earth while maintaining the wonder and awe of superpowers.

Many stories are told from the perspective of regular people living in Astro City, many of the heroes and villains are just regular people with capes. No matter the perspective the story is being told from, Astro City acknowledges that everyone is human and, powers or not, deals with human issues (alien invaders excluded).

Astro City is a reconstruction of the superhero genre instead of a deconstruction. It's a precursor to comics like Invincible and the Boys.
