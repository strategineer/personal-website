A smorgasbord of short fiction from R. A. Lafferty.

Reading through this hasn't convinced me to enjoy short fiction on its own merits. I would much rather read novellas and novels. 

I liked the following stories most: Slow Tuesday Night, Nine Hundreds Grandmothers, The Primary Education of the Camiroi, Thieving Bear Planet and Funnyfingers.
