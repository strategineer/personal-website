thoughts:

- feels like the premise of the book was a dare and the author said: "hold my beer"
  - surprisingly it works and Walschots takes the story in unexpected directions (hospitalization, extended recovery, just to name a few) that have kept me excited to see what's next
- office worker / data scientist power fantasy?
  - also Anna's arc of being a gig economy data entry henchwoman then becoming an empowered data scientist with a dream job is a vibe
- what if superheroes were bad actually? Very the boys and everything that came before it. Superheroes have been around a very long time and subversive superhero media has been too.
- Reminds me of Martha Wells's Murderbot Diaries in the way the protagonist decribes themselves --- Loves watching shows on video streaming services, loves snacks and fast food, loves brands
  - it feels like a way of catering to a specific market demographic ("Anna is just like me!") instead of being necessary.
  - It probably stands out more for me because I'm not in that demographic.
- it's political!
  - gig economy work sucks, Anna's getting a dream job is interesting but she's still labouring under capitalism... let's see where it goes from there.
  - Anna's dreamjob is a little twisted and in leading her team she's doing vigilante justice and the heroes vigilantes -> what's going to happen next? Consequences are coming I hope
  - framing villains as CEOs and small business men and heroes as dangerous vigilantes is fun
