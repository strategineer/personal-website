A post-apocalyptic story following a messiah-like figure who wishes to both: survive the horrific world she lives in with ripped from the 90s headlines / Mad Max roving gangs of murderers and rapists while also founding her own religion. 

Uhhhhh very interesting. It's a shame that Octavia E. Butler wasn't able to finish the series. Her work is always interesting if a little uneven.
