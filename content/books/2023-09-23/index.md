1/3 essays about life 1/3 book forewords 1/3 book reviews

All written by Ursula K. Le Guin between 2000 and 2016.

Ursula K. Le Guin is great, so to no one's surprise there's a lot to love about
this text.

<!--more-->

As Le Guin writes in the book itself, the forewords and reviews she's written
here shouldn't be misconstrued as recommendations per say.

But from reading the text, it's relatively easy to tell the difference between
her really liking a book/author vs. her being paid to write some fluff about a
book/author.

Le Guin gushing over José Saramago's work in the foreword of an anthology of his
work as well as several reviews stood out to me. I'm VERY excited to dive into
his work.

EDIT 2023-12-02: José Saramago is great, I can confirm that now. See my other
reviews.
