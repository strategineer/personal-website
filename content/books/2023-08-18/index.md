An absolute page turner if I've ever read one (I couldn't put this book down). Each time I sat down to read, it only took a few sentences to transport me completely into this world that V.E. Schwab has so carefully built.

A Gathering of Shadows develops the characters introduced in the previous book (along with some fresh faces), portrays the evolution of their relationships with one another and sets everything up for what I'm confident is going to be a riveting conclusion to the trilogy.

Reading through A Darker Shade of Magic, I became a fan of V.E. Schwab's work. Reading through the sequel I've been left slack jawed in awe.

I've read a lot of books in my life and I can count on one hand the number of times I've felt this blown away by words on a page.

Just stop whatever you're doing and read these books. Thank you.
