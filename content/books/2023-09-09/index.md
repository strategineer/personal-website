This book is terrible. I read through this whole novel and I don't have anything to show for it.

I probably should have put the book down and lit it on fire when the gigantic black Rastafarian sumo wrestler in a diaper showed up. I probably should have stopped reading when the profoundly unlikable protagonist turns out to be a pedo. I probably should have stopped reading when I realized that none of the characters were interesting.

This book could be a third of the length and nothing of substance would be lost. Well, this book could not exist and nothing of substance would be lost.

If it were up to me, I would go back in time to ensure that this book never gets published or even written in the first place to stop myself from reading it.

Taking the Alice in Wonderland premise of someone falling into another world completely unlike their own is really cool and I've really enjoyed other texts that use this trope (specifically the Gregor the Underground Chronicles books by Suzanne Collins). So I was completely ready and willing to open my mind and enjoy Neverwhere.

Unfortunately it sucks a$$. There's only so much I can do to look past all of the cringe inducing white man POV present in this book.

NB: I read the "Author's Preferred Text" version of this text published in 2016. I'm not certain what changes were made to the text compared to the original but just FYI.
