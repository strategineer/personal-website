Many roleplaying systems claim to support play in any kind of setting but few really do --- Savage Worlds is an exception. It's got crunchy-enough systems that are only as relevant as you want them to be.

Savage Worlds is the most "more than the sum of its parts" tabletop roleplaying system I've played --- it rocks.

I can't say enough good things about Savage Worlds:

- Bennies (tokens awarded to players for good roleplay that allow them to change fate when the outcome of a dice roll really matters to them).
- Exploding Dice and Raises (whenever you high roll on a die, you roll it again and sum the results, repeating this as many times as needed --- in other games you can crit, in Savage Worlds you can **CRIT**)
- Wild Dice (whenever you roll a die for an attribute or skill check, you roll whatever dice you need to roll depending on your attribute or skill **AND** you also roll a d6, you then take the highest result ). Wild Dice encourage players to let their characters do things that they aren't necessarily good at (especially if it's good roleplaying, which might get them a Benny) because they're more likely to succeed and much less likely to critically fail (requiring snake eyes, which has at worst a 1/24 chance of occurring and at best 1/72) than in other roleplaying games (think DnD).
- It actually does support any kind of setting you can come up with --- it just works. It's design is super hackable and it's designed to be so.
