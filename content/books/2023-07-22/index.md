Humm...

It was OK.

Unlike The Galaxy and The Ground Within (also written by Becky Chambers), this novella doesn't have a lot of space (see what I did there?) to develop its characters and have you care about them.

There's a little bit of tension as the crew navigates to each planet they've been tasked with scouring for life. Will they be ok? What will they find? Etc.

But it was hard for me to care.

I powered through the novella because Becky Chambers's writing style is easy to read but I'm not sure I got much out of reading it.
