summary: "As someone who's been suffering with chronic pain issues for years now, I'm always on the lookout for anything I can do to help myself feel less pain. Underneath all the quackery contained in this book there's a grain of truth (for me) that seems to have helped me drastically reduce my chronic pain symptoms. The crux of the book is that chronic pain can be a Pavlovian response you've learned after suffering an injury. When you're desperate, you'll try anything. And, I didn't see much harm in applying the simple techniques pretended in the book, and I'm glad I did because it seems like it's working."

You should always be skeptical of someone presenting a cure-all.

"Just do X and all of your problems will go away!"

We all know that's unlikely to be true.

Dr. Sarno presents his solution as being the solution for many many problems.

But, reading a book and thinking about it a little is a small price to pay for the possibility of solving an issue like chronic pain.

So why not?
