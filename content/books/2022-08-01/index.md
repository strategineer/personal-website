As someone who's been suffering with chronic pain issues for years now, I'm
always on the lookout for anything I can do to help myself feel less pain.
Underneath all the quackery contained in this book there seems to be a grain of
truth (for me, at least). It helped helped me reduce my chronic pain symptoms
considerably in just a short amount of time. If you (or someone you know)
suffers from chronic pain, I would highly recommend this book.

The crux of the book is that for some people chronic pain is a Pavlovian
response programmed into you shortly after suffering an injury, causing you pain
ever after despite the inciting injury having been healed a long time ago.

When you're desperate, you'll try anything. And, I didn't see much harm in
applying the simple techniques presented in the book, and I'm glad I did because
it seems like it's working.

But, you should always be skeptical of someone presenting you with a cure-all.

"Just do X and all of your problems will go away!"

No matter how desperate you are, you have to realize that this is unlikely to be
true.

Dr. Sarno presents his solution as being the solution for many more problems
than seems reasonable given the data available to him (his own experience in his
clinical practice).

But, reading a book and thinking about it a little is a small price to pay for
the possibility of finding a way of improving my life substantially by reducing
(or eliminating if we're lucky) my chronic pain.

So why not?

His ideas line up with what I've learned on my own having to deal with chronic
pain for years and it's working so far.

So at the end of the day, if it works and it's not harmful then is it really
quackery?
