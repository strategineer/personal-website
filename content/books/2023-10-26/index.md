Part 1: Amazing. Seems like this could have easily been an inspiration for the
old school Fallout games I've always loved. Following one monk through the
post-apocalypse is cool.

Part 2: Gigantic shift in tone. A less personal, more political story takes
hold. Kind of hard to get through. The shift was really jarring.

Part 3: I haven't gotten that far yet.

I'll have to get back to this eventually, it has a lot of potential but it was a
challenge for me to read initially.
