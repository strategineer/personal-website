My buddy who's a bartender recommended this to me when I expressed interest in
learning how to mix cocktails. It's got a bunch of good cocktail recipes and
historical context for most of them (if you're into that kind of thing).

Interestingly, in the first few pages, Gary describes bartenders as being
"Ganymedes", a young boy (remember this) who is the immortal cupbearer of
Olympus in Greek mythology. This comparison is one you would probably avoid
after reading Robert Graves's take on Ganymedes.

Robert posits that Ganymedes was a character created by the Greeks/Romans much
later on and "retconned" back into the mythology to legitimize their rampant
pederasty. Have fun with that information.
