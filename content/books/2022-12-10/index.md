summary: "A cool guy devil and a flamboyantly effeminate angel living on Earth try to stop the end times from happening because they've come to enjoy all of Earth's pleasures (mosly driving fast cars and reading, respectively). Also, there's the anti-christ, a descendant of a prophet who's predicted everything, some dude, etc. There's a lot going on here."

On the heels of reading [the Colour of Magic](/books/2022-11-28/) and enjoying it a lot I decided to read Good Omens. I've read a lot of Neil Gaiman and I've enjoyed most of his work so I decided that it was about time I read this book.

As I started reading, I realized that I had tried to read this book probably over a decade ago and dropped it (I don't remember why).

Good Omens starts off strong and ends strong, and I've come to appreciate the middle part more and more as I've taken some distance from the book. But, in the moment, actually reading it, I found the middle to be boring and meandering at times.

> Maybe this is because the book was written by two authors?

Despite this, Good Omens is unique and I can recommend it.
