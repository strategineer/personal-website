Charles, a valet robot, is let go from his job and then goes on a journey of self-discovery. Hijinks ensue.

Feels like a spiritual successor to {{< book_url "Dogs of War" >}} from 2016. Service Model is also a story set in a dystopian world told from a unique and limited POV that grows and evolves throughout the book.

This is shaping up to be my favorite Tchaikovsky novel.
