Off-brand Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles TTRPG. Great idea, but seems a little uninspired and too crunchy for its own good. The multiplicative math with percents using non d100 dice is particularly egregious.

Quote from the revised edition:

{{< quote "7">}}
**REDUCE TO X/X**: When a value is reduced to an explicit fraction (½, ¼), it is done after the addition of any % values is resolved (rounding off). So, if a character has a speed of 12 and adds 150% for a total of 30, but has a trait that reduces it to ½, the fraction would be multiplied after; for a total of 15. If multiple traits reduce a value to a fraction, use the smallest of the multiple fractions. See “Add %”.

This is absurd.

I don't think crunchy systems like this are for me especially when the crunchy toolbox doesn't set my brain on fire. It's just so boring.

**AQUATIC SCENT**: You may detect scents underwater.

I guess being really charitable about this system, if you've got a group of friends who are really into the idea of playing as anthropomorphic animals (cough furries cough) then this might be exactly the system for you, especially if you're willing to put up with the crunch or, god forbid, you get a sick pleasure out of doing math with your friends.
