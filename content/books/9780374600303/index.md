title: The Bee Sting
---

An Irish multi-pov family tragicomedy.

<!--more-->

The Bee Sting reads like a prestige TV show condensed into a novel. Clocking in at over 600 pages, it's an absolute behemoth that I devoured in just a few days.

Murray's characters are experts at steering themselves into one disaster after another. Reading the book is like watching a train wreck on repeat --- if the trains were barreling forward at breakneck speed, which they are. Murray relentlessly accelerates the pace, ensuring that the momentum never falters.

The novel begins at a measured pace, gradually peeling back the layers of the Barnes family's inner lives. For roughly the first hundred pages or so, we follow Cass, the teenage daughter, as she navigates the lead-up to her college entrance exams. But as the narrative unfolds, Murray masterfully juggles the multiple points of view, switching between them every other paragraph by the book's end.

This narrative technique builds toward a climax where every character, along with their secrets and escalating dilemmas, collides in a final, chaotic maelstorm.

One of Murray's standout achievements in the Bee Sting is his ability to craft distinct, vibrant voices for each character --- something that too many authors struggle to do.

Imelda, the Barnes matriarch, offers the most singular perspective of all. Her chapters evoke the style of JosÃ© Saramago, with dialogue and inner monologues that blur seamlessly together, perfectly reflecting her effervescent personality.

There's plenty to love in the Bee Sting, and I'd recommend it to anyone in search of a well-crafted, engrossing read. Just be prepared: as the layers peel back, darkness and tragedy lurk in every corner.

> - Both novels feature small towns with inescapable gravitational pulls.
> - Both are sprawling narratives filled with flawed characters who double down on their missteps, tumbling down their own slippery slopes, and finding themselves on collision courses with one another.
