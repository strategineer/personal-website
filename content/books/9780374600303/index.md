title: The Bee Sting
---

An Irish multi-pov family tragicomedy.

<!--more-->

The Bee Sting reads like a prestige TV show in book form. It's an absolute brick of a novel coming in at more than 600 pages --- but one I was compelled to read all the way through.

Characters in the Bee Sting often find themselves in bad situations and choose to swerve themselves into even worse ones repeatedly. Reading the Bee Sting is like watching a train crash over and over again.

And these trains (plural) are going very fast. Paul Murray's accelerating of the pace of the novel all throughout is unparalleled.

The book starts by following the life of Cass, the teenage daughter of the Barnes family, for a hundred pages or so. By the end of the book, Murray switches between POVs every paragraph.

In doing so, Murray effectively builds up to conclusion of the novel when all the characters, their problems, and the consequences of the secrets they've kept all collide with one another in a whirlwind of chaos for one last time.

In the Bee Sting, Murray also demonstrates an excellent ability to give each pov character their own unique voice --- bringing them to life in ways that other authors often fail to.

The most different of the POVs is Imelda's, the wife and mother of the Barnes family. Her chapters read like a JosÃ© Saramago novel. With little to no punctuation to be found in her chapters, Imelda's dialogue and thoughts all blend into one another.

There's a lot to love in the Bee Sting and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a well-written and entertaining book to read.

As long as you're expecting things to get dark in a variety of ways that come with the territory of tragedy, you'll probably have a good time with it.

> - Both feature small towns with gravities that make it hard to escape from them or forget about them when you finally do.
> - Both are gigantic books filled with flawed characters who are constantly double-downing on their flaws, tumbling down their own slippery slopes, and finding themselves on collision courses with one another.
