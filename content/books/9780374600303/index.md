title: The Bee Sting
---

An Irish multi-pov family tragicomedy.

<!--more-->

The Bee Sting reads like a prestige TV show in book form. It's an absolute brick of a novel, coming in at more than 600 pages --- but one I was compelled to read all the way through in just a few days.

Characters in the Bee Sting often find themselves in bad situations and choose to swerve into even worse ones repeatedly. Reading the Bee Sting is like watching a train crash over and over again.

And these trains (plural) are going very fast. Paul Murray's accelerating of the pace of the novel all throughout is unparalleled.

The book starts out slowly --- gradually revealing the inner lives of the four members of the Barnes family. We start with Cass, the teenage daughter of the family, living her life leading up to her college entrance exams --- for about hundred pages or so. By the end of the book, Murray is switching between the different POVs, every other paragraph.

In doing so, Murray effectively builds up to conclusion of the novel when all the characters, their problems, and the consequences of the secrets they've kept all collide with one another in a whirlwind of chaos for one last time.

In the Bee Sting, Murray also demonstrates an excellent skill in giving each POV character their own unique voice separate from his own --- bringing them to life in ways that other authors often fail to (*cough* {{< book_url "A Desolation Called Peace">}} *cough*).

The most unique of the POVs is Imelda's, the wife and mother of the Barnes family. Her chapters read like a JosÃ© Saramago novel. With little to no punctuation to be found in her chapters, Imelda's dialogue and thoughts all blend into one another --- briging life to her effervescent personality.

There's a lot to love in the Bee Sting and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a well-written and entertaining book to read.

As long as you're expecting things to get dark in a variety of ways that come with the territory of tragedy, you'll probably have a good time with it.

> - Both feature small towns with gravities that make it hard to escape from them or forget about them when you finally do.
> - Both are gigantic books filled with flawed characters who are constantly double-downing on their flaws, tumbling down their own slippery slopes, and finding themselves on collision courses with one another.
