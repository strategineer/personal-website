title: On the Meaning of Life
---

One part racist sexist misguided grandpa waxing philosophical about the meaninglessness of life, one part letters responding to Durant's inflamattory prompt on the meaninglessness of life, one part toothless conclusion. Meh.

Some of the letters were interesting to read but most of the rest of this was not.
