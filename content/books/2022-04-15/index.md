title: The Pig That Wants To Be Eaten
---

The Pig That Wants to Be Eaten offers one hundred philosophical thought-experiments. To get the most out of it, you might want to pull it out and discuss a thought-experiment with some friends because the book doesn't do much more than present the thought-experiments one after the other.

Boring...

Dry (and weirdly conservative, thanks old British guy). Not sure this book is worth much if you read it from start to finish on your own (like I did).

Depending on what kind of parties you like to throw, I'd suggest gathering some philosophically minded friends, flipping to a random page, explaining the thought experiment and discussing it as a group.
