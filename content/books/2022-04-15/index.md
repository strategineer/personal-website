summary: "The Pig That Wants to Be Eaten offers one hundred philosophical thought-experiments. To get the most out of it, you might want to pull it out and discuss a thought-experiment with some friends because the book doesn't do much more than present the thought-experiments one after the other."

Low key boring.

Dry (and weirdly conservative in parts). Not sure this is worth much on its own.

Flip to a random page, explain the thought experiment to some friends and discuss it.

That seems like the only way to get value out of this book (you can also burn it for warmth or wipe your ass with it I guess).
