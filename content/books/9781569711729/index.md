Dirty Pair is:
- The eponymous pair, Kei and Yuri, of bio-engineered "trouble consultants" sent all over the universe to deal with "trouble"---often achieving their goals with a blatant disregard for the "collateral damage" they cause.
- An American comic serialized between 1988 and 2002 based on a Japanese light novel series. It's a raunchy science fiction action comedy with a healthy dose of cyberpunk esthetics spliced into it.
  - Not to be confused with *The Great Adventures of the Dirty Pair* manga from 2010-2011 by Hisao Tamaki. I don't know much about this adaptation other than the character designs being a little bland.
- A decades long-running comic with a visual style that's changed so much (getting much worse rather than better) despite being drawn by the same artist throughout its entire run.
- A heavily episodic comic that takes a little while to "get good". You might want to start reading at *A Plague of Angels*.
- [Well-loved by its fans](https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2023/10/essay-adam-warrens-the-dirty-pair-is-a-forgotten-sci-fi-classic/)
- Post-modern. Warren is well-aware of what the Dirty Pair comic is. Especially starting from *A Plague of Angels* onwards, Adam Warren seems to become more interested in putting textual commentary into the text itself.
  - In *A Plague of Angels*, the journalist Cory is introduced to the story (she's cannonically trans which is cool) and is tasked with following the Dirty Pair on one of their missions. Through Cory, Warren explicitly frames the Dirty Pair as being the whirlwind of chaos and destruction that they are (whereas prior to Cory's introduction, this theme of the show was mostly implicit).
  - In *Fatal and not Serious*, Cory is re-introduced to the story as a talk show host interviewing the Dirty Pair in the days before the inaugural Kei n' Yuri con 41, an in-universe fandom convention dedicated to the main characters of the comic book. An in-universe pair of AI hosts cover the events of the con live through personalized video streams to convention goers. In the comic, panels of commentary are spliced into the events of the comic providing color commentary, textual analysis and serve as another lens through which to view the Dirty Pair's shenaningans---all within the comic itself.
- A little uneven. The first few arcs are really big standard, lacking the oomhph that makes the rest of the series stand out, and the last arc's art style is bad and just isn't that interesting.
