Dirty Pair is:
- The eponymous pair of bio-engineered "trouble consultants" sent all over the universe to deal with "trouble"---often achieving their goals with a blatant disregard for the "collateral damage" they cause.
- An American comic serialized between 1988 and 2002 based on a Japanese light novel series. It's a raunchy science fiction action comedy with a healthy dose of cyberpunk esthetics spliced into it.
  - Not to be confused with *The Great Adventures of the Dirty Pair* manga from 2010-2011 by Hisao Tamaki. I don't know much about this adaptation other than the character designs being a little bland.
- A decades long-running comic with a visual style that's changed so much (getting much worse rather than better) despite being drawn by the same artist throughout its entire run.
- A heavily episodic comic that takes a little a while to "get good". You might want to start reading at *A Plague of Angels*.
- [Well-loved by its fans](https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2023/10/essay-adam-warrens-the-dirty-pair-is-a-forgotten-sci-fi-classic/)
