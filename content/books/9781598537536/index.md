Eh... It's OK.

The Complete Alyx stories: ⭐⭐___

Nothing too special here. Really not what I was expecting. This seems like it could have been somewhat revolutionary at the time but in 2024, having a woman protagonist isn't enough to make a text interesting.

These stories aren't continuous and don't fall into the same genre and don't even feature the same Alyx character. It's hard to evaluate these as a collection of cohesive stories. They're kind of all over the place in terms of when and where these stories are taking place but also in terms of writing style.

The last one is the only one I really enjoyed reading. It's very high concept, the writing is evocative and it's short. That's the only story I can recommend with caveats.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend these stories.

The Female Man: _____

Interesting so far. Maybe this story has aged better?

Somewhat Wolfe-ian. I'm intrigued...
