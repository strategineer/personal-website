Eh... It's OK.

The Complete Alyx stories: ⭐⭐___

Nothing too special here. Really not what I was expecting. This seems like it could have been somewhat revolutionary at the time but in 2024, having a woman protagonist isn't enough to make a text interesting.

These stories aren't continuous and don't fall into the same genre category and necessarily even feature the same Alyx character. It's hard to evaluate these as a collection of stories.

The last one is the only one I really enjoyed reading. It's very high concept, the writing is evocative and it's short. That's the only story I can recommend.

The Female Man: _____

Interesting so far. Maybe this story has aged better?

Somewhat Wolfe-ian.
