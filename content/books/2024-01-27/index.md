I love Greek mythology which definitely elevated my appreciation of this text.

If you're not already a big fan of Greek mythology, you're unlikely to get much
out of it though.

I read through it out loud for about half of it and then finished the rest
silently because it was taking me too long.

I'm sure the author would recommend the audiobook because this is a story best
told orally.
