summary: "Games are a unique art form. They do not just tell stories, nor are they simply conceptual art. They are the art form that works in the medium of agency. C. Thi Nguyen's Games: Agency as Art dives deep into these ideas and expands on them."

A man after my own heart. C. Thi Nguyen wants us to understand why games are interesting under the lens of "agency".

Games as in sports, video games, board games, etc.

I love all of these things (sport a bit less these days) and they're a big part of my life and so there's value in me exploring why they might be more interesting than they might appear to be on a surface level.

Reading this book might make me a better game critic and better at sharing my love of games with other people.
