Amazing introductory OSR module for level 1 PCs. This is a great module to run if you've never run a tabletop RPG before or if you'd like to introduce new people to the tabletop roleplaying hobby.

The presentation and layout is top notch and makes for a compelling and breezy read. Ripe for expansion, elaboration and improvisation if you'd like to but this module can be run straight with little to no changes required.

I chose to start my players off in media res to present them with a prototypical OSR-style encounter to handle at the start of the session.

During character creation I gave them the premise of the module and skipped over the "arriving at the village" part, right to the "going on an expedition to get something to help with the golden veil surrounding the temple" part.

So, I added a bridge troll-in-training blocking their path towards the Gloamwood. But I can imagine you choosing to start your players off in the town with less of an initial railroad if you're planning a campaign (instead of a one-shot) and you're running a session with players experienced with roleplaying and OSR-style play. Even in that case, providing a patron with a clear goal and direction for players to strive towards might be good to start the campaign/module off on the right foot.

Kids with trained imaginations can have fun with sandboxes but the adults you're probably playing with might need a little guidance to ease them into the premise and their role in it.
