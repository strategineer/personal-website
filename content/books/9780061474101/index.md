Intricate world building, a firehose of philosophical ideas to think about and a compelling narrative all packed into a 900+ page brick of a novel.

I read some of Neal Stephenson's earlier work (Diamond Age and Cryptonomicon) when I was younger but I didn't "get" them at the time. After loving Anathem so much, I'm curious to read those books again.
