Mary Gentle's fantasy satire with grit. Think Terry Pratchett but more mature and with a lot more gore and violence.

Kicking off the book with the "nameless necromancer" completely wasted on wine, sending off one of his orc captains on a quest of some sort was a great way to start.

I think this is going to be a goldmine for fantasy roleplaying ideas...

{{< quote 25 >}} "Ned and Will Brandiman," Ned introduced. "Notorious 'alflings. Sir and madam, you are looking at two of the greatest professionals it will ever be your good fortune to meet. As to what we do, we find lost property."

Shazgurim snorted. "And is it usually lost before you two 'find' it?"

"Now that you come to mention itâ€¦"

Ashnak nodded his great tusked head. "Thieves. Our master the nameless said there would be thieves."

"We prefer the term adventurers. It sounds so much more respectable." Will brushed himself down and strolled across the dip to look at the ransacked chests. "You realise it will be necessary to return the tools of our trade? And, now I come to think about it, we have no transport. I think it would probably be advisable for you to detail one of your warriors to carry these chests for us." {{< /quote >}}
