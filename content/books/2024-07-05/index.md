Mary Gentle's Grunts in a nutshell. Grunts is a satire of the schlocky high fantasy Tolkien ripoffs of the 70s and 80s. It also pokes fun at the aesthetic of the American military as portrayed in film and literature.

The story begins with a group of orcs, the Agaku, being tasked with stealing powerful yet non-magical weapons from a dragon's hoard. At the request of the nameless necromancer, Ashnak leads his orcs to the hoard in preparation for the Last Battle between the forces of Light and Dark.

These weapons turn out to be an impressive array of modern military equipment: assault rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, tanks, helicopters, surface to air missile launchers...

You name it, they've got it.

Prior to finding these weapons, the Agaku were stereotypical generic fantasy orcs: a little stupid, violent, strong. After finding the military equipment they turn into Vietnam War-era hurrah-ing, tabbaco chewing, cigar smoking American soldiers (but what if they were orcs fighting against the forces of "Good").

Hijinks ensue.

**Minor Spoilers Ahead**

It turns out that despite having access to advanced weapons aren't enough to turn the battle. The forces of Light win the great battle. In the following months, they chase down and exterminate the remaining forces of Dark,  including the orc marines.

This leads to a siege where the orc marines holding down the fort of InDeen (?) against a siege by the forces of Light. 

Let's talk about the forces of Light. Epic fantasy has always had a problematic relationship with presenting good/bad in black and white terms with little room in between. My understanding is that this simplicity appeals to the human desire to constantly simplify the eternally complex real world in order to live within it.

That's fine. But by presenting good/bad like this, it's easy to fall into the trap (intentionally or not) of depicting certain beings as inherently evil. 

Dehumanizing the human.

Mary Gentle portrays the forces of Light and Dark....


 posits that the weapons we have access to change us (power corrupts), she posits that power is power and war is war,

... fantasy satire with grit. Think Terry Pratchett but more mature and with a lot more gore and violence.

....

themes to explore: ethnic cleansing,  rnd orc with gold eyes (1/8th elven)

Kicking off the book with the "nameless necromancer" completely wasted on wine, sending off one of his orc captains on a quest of some sort was a great way to start.

I think this is going to be a goldmine for fantasy roleplaying ideas...

Shazgurim snorted. "And is it usually lost before you two 'find' it?"

"Now that you come to mention itâ€¦"

Ashnak nodded his great tusked head. "Thieves. Our master the nameless said there would be thieves."

"We prefer the term adventurers. It sounds so much more respectable." Will brushed himself down and strolled across the dip to look at the ransacked chests. "You realise it will be necessary to return the tools of our trade? And, now I come to think about it, we have no transport. I think it would probably be advisable for you to detail one of your warriors to carry these chests for us." {{< /quote >}}
