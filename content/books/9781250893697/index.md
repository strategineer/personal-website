Around 400 BCE, in Syracuse, Dumb and Dumber want to put on a play by Euripides.

They've got no actors, no costumes, no sets, no money and little to no intelligence. But, as they say, where there is a quarry filled with starving Athenian refugees, there's a way.

This tragic comic story is told from a skewed POV. I'm not sure of there are big meta fictional swings coming but there could be.

I like the tone of the text. The juxtaposition of modern vulgar language meshed with the historical fictional context is interesting. Various people within the text speak very differently from one another.
