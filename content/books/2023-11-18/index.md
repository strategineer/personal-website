A collection of small one shot tabletop RPGs. Their quality varies and not all of them will be interesting to the people you play with BUT there's some bangers in here.

<!--more-->

I read through all of them and picked out a few that seemed interesting, presented them to my group and we chose to play Unkindness, a game about adolescent ravens causing havoc and experiencing emotions.

It was really funny and it pushed us into different headspaces. There was an interesting contrast between the lofty goals we set out to achieve (stealing some clothing from a baby) and the more grounded results we actually got (NOT stealing clothes from a baby, becoming depressed, dying / mourning over our dead friend).

That was 1 game out of 40, and I'm excited to try a few more of them out with the same group. Even just playing 1 game, I got my money's worth.

So even though I don't see myself playing most of the games in this collection (because they're meant for 1 or 2 players, they don't look exciting, the design is too complicated, etc.), that doesn't matter.
