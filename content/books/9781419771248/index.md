Given the way the in-universe author frames the story he's about to tell, I was expecting for the novel to be more epic in scope and cover a much longer span of the narrator's life. Instead, we only get ~4-6 years of the narrator's childhood. The events of those years were captivating but I was a little dissapointed I didn't get the epic story I was expecting to read.
