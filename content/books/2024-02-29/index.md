An edgy retelling of Peter Pan by Brom, the illustrator who's work you've definitely seen before (Doom II, Diablo II).

<!--more-->

Suffers from both "white man syndrome", racist caricatures and paper thin women, and "first novel syndrome", unpolished and rough main character.

The illustrations are great though and it had potential.

I've heard that his more recent work, Slewfoot, is much better and I'm planning to read it eventually.
