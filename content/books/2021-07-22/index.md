summary: "Sandcastles is the french comic book that the recent M. Night Shyamalan's movie Old was based on. A bunch of different people arrive for a relaxing day at the beach and find themselves aging extremely rapidly, babies become teens and older folk die. Hijinks ensue. I don't get it."

I didn't like Sandcastles. I'm not exactly qualified to critique graphic novels. I'm either too stupid to understand what it's trying to say or it's not trying to say anything at all. Either way, it didn't make me feel anything... Maybe I'm dead inside?
