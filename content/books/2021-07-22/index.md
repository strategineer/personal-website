Sandcastles is the french comic book that the recent M. Night Shyamalan's movie
Old was based on. A bunch of different people arrive for a relaxing day at the
beach and find themselves aging extremely rapidly, babies become teens and older
folk die. Hijinks ensue. I don't get it.

I didn't like Sandcastles. I'm not exactly qualified to critique graphic novels.
I'm either too stupid to understand what it's trying to say or it's not trying
to say anything at all. Either way, it didn't make me feel anything... Maybe I'm
dead inside?
