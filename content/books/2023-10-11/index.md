Old Testament fan fiction written by the militantly atheist Jose Saramago.

Color me intrigued.

Cain, the murderer of Abel, wanders around iconic moments from the Old Testament (Noah's Ark, the Tower of Babel, Sodom, Jericho, etc.) and points out how the God of the Old Testament is fucked up and not worth worshipping.

This is kind of a weird one. I don't think Jose Saramago is going to be converting anyone with this text. It's short, if you're curious and a fan of Jose Saramago, go for it.
