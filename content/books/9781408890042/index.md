Madeline Miller, the first and the greatest of the authors writing Greek mythology fan fiction, like the hammer of Hephaestus, strikes again.

Circe rewrites the story of, well, Circe who you may have seen in Homer's Odyssey. It was fantastic and I'm excited to read her previous novel, the Song of Achilles.
