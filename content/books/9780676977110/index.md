title: Never Let Me Go

Kathy describes herself as a "carer for donors". She tells us about her life, the boarding school she grew up in, the people she crossed paths with, and how she became a "carer".

Never Let Me Go's protagonist Kathy is one of the most boring narrators to ever grace the page. Ishiguro's choice of narrator combined with the mundane story, despite seemingly serving a greater thematic purpose, was torturous to read through.

Underneath this boring veneer lies an ambiguous novel that is worth thinking about critically. But I found it so hard to find the energy to do so because of Ishiguro's total disinterest in telling a story that's both entertaining when taken at face value and when examined more closely.

> Unlike something like {{< book_url "The Wizard Knight" >}} which is a blast to read straight and tremendously fun to think after the fact. Not every book has to be like this but I really like books that do this.

So much of what I was interested to explore in Never Let Me Go, like the frame narrative and the specifics of the world and how it might be different than our own and what it means for me, were left mostly unexplored.

It's hard to say whether Ishiguro's repeated process of building reader expectations and then never satisfyingly cashing them out is intentional or just bad writing. Either way, I found it hard to enjoy.

I think I would have appreciated Never Let Me Go if it were more of a science fiction novel, focused on exploring a world unlike our own and what it means for us and ours, and less of a literary fiction novel, focused on exploring the inner life (or lack of one) of one emotionless boring AF girl in a boarding school.

Never Let Me Go's world seems internally consistent even though at first glance it might not appear to be because of how limited and skewed Kathy's perspective is.

It all makes sense to me, but it just wasn't much fun to read about Kathy losing a cassette tape, or her frenemy Ruth losing a pencil case, or her friend Tommie having a temper tantrum when Ishiguro could have been telling us about these same moments through a less boring narrator or picking more interesting parts of his world to explore.

All that said, I wish I liked Never Let Me Go more than I did.
