Kathy describes herself as a "carer for donors". She tells us about her life, the boarding school she grew up in, the people she crossed paths with, and how she became a "carer".

Never Let Me Go's protagonist Kathy is one of the most boring narrators to ever grace the page. Ishiguro's choice of narrator combined with the mundane story, despite seemingly serving a greater thematic purpose, was torturous to read through.

But if you scratch away its thick veneer of utter boredom, you'll see that Never Let Me Go is an ambiguous novel, worth thinking about critically. But, I found myself lacking the energy to do so from Ishiguro's total disinterest in telling a story that's entertaining when taken at face value.

> Unlike something like {{< book_url "The Wizard Knight" >}} which is a blast to read straight and tremendously fun to think about after the fact. Not every author can be Gene Wolfe (not even Gene Wolfe could be Gene Wolfe really) but sometimes I wish they were.

It's hard to say whether Ishiguro's repeated process of building up reader expectations and then never satisfyingly cashing them out is intentional or just bad writing. Either way, I found it hard to enjoy.

Much of what I was curious about the premise in Never Let Me Go was mostly left unexplored or completely forgotten by the end of the novel. Reading the first chapter you might assume that Never Let Me Go is a frame narrative. I love frame narratives so you can imagine my dissapointment when this gets completely forgotten about.

I was also curious about seeing Ishiguro dig deeper into this alternate world constantly being gestured at but always managing to be just slightly off the page. The alternate history setting turns out to be more of an excuse to be very "literary" and explore Kathy internal inner life, the little of it that there is.

Basically, I would have appreciated Never Let Me Go if it were more of a science fiction novel, focused on exploring a world unlike our own and what it means for us and ours, and less of a literary fiction novel, focused on exploring the inner life (or lack of one) of one emotionless boring AF girl in a boarding school.

Never Let Me Go's world seems internally consistent even though at first glance it might not appear to be because of how limited and skewed Kathy's perspective is.

It all makes sense to me, but it just wasn't much fun to read about Kathy losing a cassette tape, or her frenemy Ruth losing a pencil case, or her friend Tommie having a temper tantrum when Ishiguro could have been telling us about these same moments through a less boring narrator or picking more interesting parts of his world to explore.

All that said, I wish I liked Never Let Me Go more than I did.
