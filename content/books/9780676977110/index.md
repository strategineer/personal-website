Kathy describes herself as a "carer for donors". She tells us the story of her childhood and how she became a carer.

Never Let Me Go's protagonist Kathy is one of the most boring narrators to ever grace the page. Ishiguro's choice of narrator combined with the mundane moment to moment story, despite serving a greater thematic purpose, was torturous to read through.

Underneath this boring veneer lies an ambiguous novel that is worth thinking about critically.

I found it hard to push past Ishiguro's complete disinterest in telling a story that's interesting without having to unpack all its layers. Although, because the story at face value is so boring that there's nothing left for a reader to do other than burn the book or examine it more carefully.

Reading through it and chatting about it (buddy reads!) over the course of a few weeks, I found myself swinging between wanting to think about the book on a deeper level and wanting to throw the book out of the window.  

So much of what I was interested to explore in Never Let Me Go, like the frame narrative and the specifics of the world and how it might be different than our own, were left mostly unexplored.

It's hard to say whether Ishiguro's repeated at building up expectations and then never satisfyingly cashing them out is intentional or just bad writing. Either way, I found it hard to enjoy.

I think I would have appreciated Never Let Me Go if it were more of a science fiction novel, focused on exploring a world unlike our own and what it means for ours, and less of a literary fiction novel, focused on exploring the inner life (or lack of one) of one emotionless boring AF girl in a boarding school.

Never Let Me Go's world seems internally consistent even though at first glance it feels as though it might be easy to poke holes into it because of how limited and skewed Kathy's perspective.

I wish Ishiguro would have explored more interesting parts of the world in the text instead of focusing on the mundane told from the perspective of a boring, emotionally stunted (possibly soulless) Kathy.

It all makes sense, but it just wasn't fun to read.
