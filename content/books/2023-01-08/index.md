Brave New World is a dystopian novel from 1932 about dystopian shit and it has a lot to say about the dystopia we're currently living in.

Brave New World was on some kind of reading list when I was in high school (don't ask me why). I didn't understand much of it because I was reading it in French (French from France that is) and I lacked the vocabulary to fully understand even a quarter of the sentences I was reading.

In [Amusing Ourselves to Death](/books/2022-05-01/), Neil Postman compares Aldous Huxley's Brave New World with George Orwell's 1984 and recommends we reevaluate the relative importance of both works. He is frustrated with the fact that 1984 is more widely read than Brave New World. In his eyes, Brave New World much more accurately predicts and reveals to us the problems in the dystopic world we're living in now, and I agree with him.

Reading his thoughts on Brave New World as well as hearing it mentioned on a podcast I've fond of (Play, Watch, Listen) led me to the conclusion that I should read this book again and try to understand it.

So here we are.
