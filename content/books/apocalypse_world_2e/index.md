The tabletop roleplaying game that inspired so many others (through their Powered by the Apocalypse branding) including games I've played and enjoyed like Blades in the Dark.

Apocalypse World has a bunch of rules and recommendations on how you as a GM need to act to have fun at the table, something many games fail to do, to my dismay. I want to run a PbtA game next, one that retains this idea of a Master of Ceremonies instead of a GM, to become a better GM whether I'm playing PbtA games or not.
