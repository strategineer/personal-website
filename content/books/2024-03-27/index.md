Way better than The Farthest Shore, which might be Ursula's worst work I've read so far. It's a sequel to both Tehanu and the Farthest Shore but I think you could probably skip The Farthest Shore and be OK with reading the rest of the series.

I've been reading the series alongside Ranged Touch Shelved by Genre podcast and it's been a lot of fun!

I have an insatiable desire to read, write, think and talk about the books I've read so a book club-like podcast is a perfect fit for me. Philosophers in Space is also great in that respect.
