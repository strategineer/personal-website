A sequel to both The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore.

Considering how uninteresting The Farthest Shore is, I'm confident saying that
you can skip that book and go straight to Tehanu.

I've been reading the series alongside Ranged Touch Shelved by Genre podcast and
it's been a lot of fun!

I have an insatiable desire to read, write, think and talk about the books I've
read so a book club-like podcast is a perfect fit for me. Philosophers in Space
is also great in that respect.
