**In fair puzzles there should always be a way out. But I saw no doorways in the sand, and try as I might I could not make the puzzle fall fair.**

Doorways in the Sand tells the story of Fred Cassidy the "Eternal Student", a man who's spent 13 years of his life as an undergrad.

He does everything he can to avoid getting a degree so he can continue benefiting from his uncle's generous will, predicated on him being in school (once he graduates he'll be cut off).

Fred's idyllic existence is disrupted by the theft of a priceless alien artifact, the star-stone. He's a person of interest for reasons outside of his control and so he is pursued by humans and aliens alike who think he can help them find the stone (can he?).

**"You are a living example of the absurdity of things."**

Hijinks ensue.

I loved Doorways in the Sand. Fred, as a lovable rogue, is great and reading about him dealing with the many absurd and surreal situations he found himself in brought me a lot of joy.

The text has aged remarkably well. If you told me that it was written yesterday (and not almost 50 years ago), I would believe you.

The text is funny and had me smirking and laughing my way through it.

**Turning, I saw Rick Liddy, an English major with an answer for everything except what to do with his degree come June.**

Also, Fred reminded me a lot of Moist von Lipwig from Terry Pratchett's novel Going Postal which might explain why I loved Doorways in the Sand so much.
