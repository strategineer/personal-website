title: Existential Psychotherapy
---

An absolute brick of a text expounding on a psychotherapy framework based on dealing with the four main existentialist issues of death, freedom, isolation and meaninglessness. Pretty enlightening so far, it's even got a description of existentialism that human beings can understand!
