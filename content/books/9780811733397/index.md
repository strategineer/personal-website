A climber's guide to movement, training and performance.

I've recently gotten into [bouldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering) (a form of free climbing where you climb on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses).

It's an absolutely amazing workout and it's super fun. After getting into the sport relatively blind, I decided to inform myself by reading a book on the subject. I checked reddit and picked up the first book that was mentioned.

I've been enthusiastic about bouldering ever since I started doing it a few weeks ago. After reading this book and getting back to the gym to put the theory into practice, I've fallen in love with it.

Gaining a better understanding of what climbing actually is (a form of vertical dancing) allowed me to complete harder climbs than I was able to previously and, in doing so, made me feel like a god.
