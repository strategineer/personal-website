A collection of science-fiction short stories that'll make you go \"huh,
interesting...\" and might encourage you to think about how technology affects
your life currently and how it might affect it in the not so distant future.

I liked this one a lot.

If you're looking for a lot of bite-sized science-fiction stories that (mostly)
pack a lot of punch then here you go.

It's easy to blast through a book like this, going from each story to the next
without really thinking about it too much. This isn't an ideal way for me to
read but instinctually I want to do this.

I think this instinct comes from my childhood where I spent a lot of time
reading as an escape from my life. Now, I'm less interested in escaping and more
interested in understanding more about the world and myself through reading.

Next time I read a collection of short stories like this I'll have to keep this
in mind.
