Another Jose Saramago banger. In All The Names,  we follow the story of Senhor Jos√© as he works in, navigates through, and subverts, the bureaucracy of the Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths.

Every paragraph screams Saramago, if you know you know, if you're into that, you're into that.
