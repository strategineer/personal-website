I've never read the Odyssey, and so I chose to read a recent translation of it by Emily Wilson.

It's written in modern English making it easy to read. There's no reason to use archaic English, which apparently is the norm with these kinds of texts, when translating a text that was originally in Greek. It's a poem with the same number of lines as the original which is just plain fun.

It's an interesting text and now I understand why some people decide to spend their entire lives thinking about it.

[I've shared a few of my thoughts on it here](/blog/2021-12-06/#the-odyssey).
