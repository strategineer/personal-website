Inverting tropes: instead of a prince saving a princess, the princess wants to kill the prince and save her sister.

It takes a while to get going by once Marra starts her quest, I was sucked in. It's a more of a preference for me, but as someone who doesn't move around a lot I always enjoy a story about someone on a journey.
