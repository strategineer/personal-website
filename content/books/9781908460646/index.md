I've played the Paranoia RPG more than a few times, it's always a blast. If you're into chaotic, goofy, absurdist, comically dystopian settings and cooperative/competitive roleplaying systems then you'll love Paranoia.

I built some Paranoia-specific tools to help me to GM Paranoia online, they might be of use to you:

- [A randomizer tool for choosing each Troubleshooter: a job, a mutation and a secret society](/bin/paranoia/).
- [A character sheet](/decks/paranoia.html).
