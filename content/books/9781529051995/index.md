Can our ragtag crew of loveable space scoundrels kill God and save the universe?

Another banger from our lord and saviour Adrian Tchaikovsky.

Personally, I would have preferred for this trilogy to be compressed into one really big novel so that Tchakovsky could avoid having to re-introduce each of the POV characters three times (once per book) and having to re-introduce the basic premise of the series's universe three times (once per book).

The book publishing industry wouldn't want this because they can make more money selling three books instead of just one. But it is what it is.

This trilogy isn't my favorite of Adrian Tchaikovsky's work, that award goes to his [Dogs of War](/books/9781786693907) novel and second place goes to his novel [Children of Time](/books/9781447273301).

But The Final Architecture is definitely his best science fiction trilogy because unlike Children of Time which was turned into a series after the fact, The Final Architecture was clearly created as a trilogy from the first place.

If you're into space operas, this one is great and it's got everything that Adrian Tchaikovsky is known for. An anti-social, brainy, mostly passive protagonist in a world filled with very alien aliens, many of whom are important POV characters each with a unique narrative voice.
