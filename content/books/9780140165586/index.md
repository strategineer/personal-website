title: Everyday Ethics - Inspired Solutions To Real-Life Dilemmas
---

Joshua Halberstam is the king of strawmanning. Every chapter involves him describing these absurd caricatures of human beings and then using them to try to say to something interesting (keyword: try).

What is presented here is not "inspired solutions to real-life dilemmas" but "thoughts and comments on fabricated dilemmas the author came up with".

It's not all drivel but there's so much of it that it was hard for me to care about the rest.
