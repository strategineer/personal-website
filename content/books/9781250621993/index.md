title: Slewfoot - A Tale of Bewitchery
---  

Tight and fun story. Suffers from being a little bit too predictable for my taste. It's playing with a lot of similar elements as Brom's other work I've read, [The Child Thief](/books/9780061671340), things like fairies, the Horned God, but Slewfoot is more successful in execution ({{< spoiler >}}pun intended{{< /spoiler >}}) and more nuanced and polished.
