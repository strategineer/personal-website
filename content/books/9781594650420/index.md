Whenever he [Moebius] finished a page, he would call me on the telephone. Driven by an irresistible curiosity, I would immediately get in my car to go see him. Every time I saw a new page, I swear on the life of my cat Kazan that I experienced a spiritual pleasure exceeding that of an orgasm. There before my eyes, I had the undeniable proof that comic book art was great art, just as respectable as the paintings hanging on the walls of museums.

Seems like Jodorowsky and Moebius's first attempt at their style of comic they'd try again with [Angel Claws](/books/9781594650123) years later. The left page has some text and a recurring less detailed drawing combined with a more detailed drawing on the right page of each fold. One of Moebius's earliest works, the Horny Goof also makes use of this. It seems like a style that he will keep coming back to. The degree of connection, thematically or otherwise, between the left and right page drawings varies between these attempts.

I like The Eyes of the Cat way more because Moebius's art in this is so detailed and evocative. After reading this I understand what people seem to like about Moebius black/white drawings.
