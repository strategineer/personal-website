title:
  9 Out Of 10 Climbers Make The Same Mistakes - Navigation Through The Maze Of
  Advice For The Self-Coached Climber
---

A bunch of mistakes climbers (apparently) make and how to avoid them. Not as
concrete and concise as I would like but if you're willing to filter out the
fluff, there's some interesting information here.

<!--more-->

Less concrete and more philosophical than the
[Self Coached Climber](/books/2022-09-15). It hides its interesting insights in
a lot of fluff and repeated information.

It starts off with a +20 page diatribe on people being scared of making mistakes
which wasn't very useful to me as someone who already loves making mistakes.

The specificity of his advice ("if you're a 15 year old climber, do X, if you're
a 16 year old climber, do Y") reeks of bad editing. Advice this specific has no
place in a book like this, because most readers are not going to be 15 year old
climbers.
