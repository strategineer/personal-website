summary: "A bunch of mistakes climbers (apparently) make and how to avoid them. Not as concrete and consise as I would like but if you're willing to filter out the fluff, there's some interesting information here."

Less concrete and more philisophical than the [Self Coached Climber](/books/2022-09-15). It hides its interesting insights in a lot of fluff and repeated information.

It starts off with a +20 page diatribe on people being scared of making mistakes which wasn't very useful to me as someone who already loves making mistakes.

The specificity of his advice ("if you're a 15 year old climber, do X, if you're a 16 year old climber, do Y") reeks of bad editing. Advice this specific has no place in a book like this, because most readers are not going to be 15 year old climbers.
