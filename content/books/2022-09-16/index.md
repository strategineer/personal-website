summary: "A bunch of mistakes that climbers (apparently) make and how to avoid them. Not as concrete and consise as I would like but if you're willing to filter out the fluff, there's some interesting information here."

Less concrete and more philisophical than the [Self Coached Climber](/books/2022-09-15). It hides its interesting insights in a lot of fluff and repeated information.

It starts off with a +20 page diatribe on people being scared of making mistakes which wasn't very useful to me as someone who already loves making mistakes.
