Spoilers below:

{{< spoiler >}}

- MC is depicted as the ultimate outsider / loser, living on top of an apartment building in a lone shipping container filled with trash, anime figurines and his PC. Over the course of the game he begins to touch grass, build connections with other people like him and leverage these connections to fight against the delusions imposed on him by others. Some endings involve him doing the exact opposite and living in a truly cursed delusional world of his own making.
- The MC's internal monologue constantly references harem / gal game tropes. CHN is a satire of the genre in that the MC is playing the role of a "typical" player of gal games constantly transposing this warped version of reality onto his own. And in some rare cases, bringing it forth into reality and creating his own little sick delusional gal game life (Nanami's route).
- I feel mixed about the typical gal game structure of a normal route followed by a route for each girl (I say girl and not woman intentionally here). Some routes are used to expand on the world in interesting ways, others are used as a satyrical hammer to get you to understand that this is a satire, and other routes left me feeling like they shouldn't have been written in the first place. There's not much gratitious horniness in the game but the stuff that's there even when it's used in the satyrical mode, I would rather a bit more restraint have been used here. The game is pretty restrained though so I can't complain (cutting to black and writing out some of the gorier stuff, but the horny stuff always gets a CG).  
- Einstein is mentioned as possibly being a Gigalomaniac (GM) by someone in the game. This is an in-universe gesture at the Great Man theory. The MC in finding or creating the `ir2` formula is shown to be someone like Einstein who may have done the same for the `e = mc^2`.
