The Anthropocene Reviewed is a book where author/youtuber John Green reviews a
random assortment of things and concepts that you wouldn't expect to see
reviewed. This conceit gives him a lot of room to write about anything he feels
like. John Green is an expert at what he does, but I don't find what he does to
be very compelling.
