I love the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games! Especially the third one. It's a game I always come back to over the years.

Over the many years since the game's were abandoned, fans took up the mantle and continued developing the games, creating a new version of the engine, putting all of the series's maps together and making everything moddable.

The GAMMA mod pack for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. which I've played recently is fantastic and the best realization of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fantasy that the original games promised but couldn't ever truly deliver on.

I'm excited as hell to read through the original inspiration for the games. I'm about 50 pages in, so far it's really good!
