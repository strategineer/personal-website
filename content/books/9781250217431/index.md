Klune's ability to insert the most heinous events/premises I've ever read in my life into the most saccharine stories I've ever read is constantly impressing.

**Spoilers for the first few chapters: **

{{< spoiler >}}
When Victor ventures into the scrapyards and finds a mass grave of androids, the hits despite it being so tonally at odds with the rest of the text being very precious. But Klune makes it work.
{{< /spoiler >}}

Klune's style here feels very similar to {{< book_url "The House In The Cerulean Sea" >}}. I suspect that I would have appreciated this book more if I'd have given myself a longer "Klune" break between reading these two books.

Also, Klune's foreword mentions that the text required extensive rewrites to remove parts of the text that "the world wasn't ready for". I really wish I could read that draft of the text.

In the Lives of Puppets was sold to me as Klune's autism book and I'm not 100% certain after reading it if that describing it that way is descriptive.

It's more of a Klune book that an autism book if that makes sense.
