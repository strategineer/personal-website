Monster of the Week is a standalone action-horror RPG for 3-5 people. Hunt high
school beasties a la Buffy the Vampire Slayer, travel the country to bring down
unnatural creatures like the Winchester brothers of Supernatural, or head up the
government investigation like Mulder and Scully. It seems OK, nothing
extraordinary or unique other than the conceit.

If you and your friends are into Monster of the Week style shows, maybe you
would be into this system?

This feels like a rulebook made for people to buy and keep on their shelf rather
than play though.

There's nothing extraordinary about the ruleset itself, it seems a little too
loose for my tastes.

But I don't expect to be playing it any time soon so what do I know?
