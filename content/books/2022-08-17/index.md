summary: "Monster of the Week is a standalone action-horror RPG for 3-5 people. Hunt high school beasties a la Buffy the Vampire Slayer, travel the country to bring down unnatural creatures like the Winchester brothers of Supernatural, or head up the government investigation like Mulder and Scully. It seems OK, nothing extraordinary or unique other than the conceit."

If you and your friends are into Monster of the Week style shows, maybe you would be into this system?

Although this feels like a rulebook made for people to buy and keep on their shelf rather than play.

There's nothing extraordinary about the ruleset itself, it seems a little too loose to my liking.
