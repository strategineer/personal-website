{{< quote "Stephen King on writing Under The Dome" >}}
I tried to write a book that would keep the pedal consistently to the metal. Nan [King's editor on Under The Dome] understood that, and whenever I weakened, she jammed her foot down on top of mine and yelled (in the margins, as editors are wont to do), 'Faster, Steve! Faster!'
{{< /quote >}}

A small American town is trapped under a gigantic forcefield (the Dome), hijinks ensue.

Stephen King's still got it.

Despite its 900 pages, this might be one of the most propulsive novels I've read. The dozens of different POVs allows King to gradually reveal all spinning murder and drug related plates he's got spinning.

It's exciting to watch them fall.
