Another novel to put on the list where we have a bunch of smaller sections within larger paragraphs acting as scene transitions and POV switches.

Most of these sections are bookended with the usual leading statement that writers end chapters with but these are written so well here and are so densely packed that it gives the whole novel an easy to read, brisk pace.

NB: {{< book_url "Held" >}} also does this to some extent with a focus on shorter sections and less leading statements.

This trend makes sense to me in the world of shrinking attention spans we live in. It's excruciatingly hard to get the average person (man?) to pick up a book when our brains have been trained by our phones to crave the constant dripfeed of dopamine provided by a like or an exploding pinata of loot.

I expect to see more and more books written this way to cater to this growing demographic of people. This isn't bad per-say just a prediction.

**Spoilers for the book below**

The romance-ness of the text...

The sex scenes are pretty explicit (a bit less so than in {{< book_url "The Extinction of Irena Rey" >}} though).
