Stanislaw Lem pops off once again. I'm blown away at how he can integrate all
these disparate emotions and ideas into one novel.

He did a similar thing for me with Solaris.

This book is very scary for how funny the first part of it is. The horror caught
me by surprise which elevated its effect on me.

I'm interested in reading more of his work!
