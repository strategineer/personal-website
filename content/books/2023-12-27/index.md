The precursor to N. K. Jemisin's Broken Earth trilogy, this is another fantasy setting fully divorced from Tolkien. For that reason alone, I'm into it. 

It features a protagonist who gets entangled with the enslaved gods who are used and abused by the people in power. Hijinks ensue.

The first novel in this series didn't capture me as much as I would have hoped but I am planning to read the rest to see how the series evolves.
