A Delta Green campaign module based on the King in Yellow, where investigators start with an investigation into a missing persons case tied to the King in Yellow and get sucked into that world.

I'm into the idea of being cursed with knowledge. Once you know something, you can't unknow it. Memes are contagious, they spread uncontrollably. Crafting an entire investigative RPG campaign around thatis really cool.

There's a lot to like in this module! I really like how it's split up into multiple sub-campaigns so players can dip their feet into the campaign without committing to years worth of roleplaying right from the start.

If players choose to stop after the first sub-campaign, they'll still get a conclusion on the story so far and closure for their characters.

This splitting up of the campaign into parts also alleviates the harsh requirements on the GM to read through and understand absolutely everything in the 400+ page text to run the game for their players.

I'd love to run this.
