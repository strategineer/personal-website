title: Snow Road Station
---

After she forgets some lines in a theatrical performance, Lulu Blake travels to Snow Road Station, the snowy Canadian town where she grew up, to attend her nephew's wedding. There she meets with her family, rekindles old relationships, forges new ones and, also, helps out harvesting maple syrup.

Snow Road Station feels like a grounded yet elevated Hallmark movie script-like story with just enough melodrama sprinkled throughout befitting Lulu's larger-than-life presence on the theatrical stage that is her life.

It's a great short, snowy yet cozy read.
