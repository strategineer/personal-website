Aliens on Earth in the early/mid 2000s and everything that follows from that. Sequel to Axiom's End, continues Cora's story and adds some new fresh characters (alien and otherwise) into the mix.

<!--more-->

This is a sequel to [Axiom's End](/books/2022-11-12/). Not much to say about it.

I probably should have written more notes about this novel while I was reading it. It's been about a month and a half now and I've forgotten a lot...

I don't think I want to read the next book in this trilogy... I probably shouldn't but I might anyway, sunk cost fallacy and all that.
