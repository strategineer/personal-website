The Annihilation book was OK but the movie is better.

Please do yourself a favor and do not read the rest of the novels in this series.

After forcing my way through the entire Southern Reach trilogy, I've decided to never read another Jeff VanderMeer novel.

Any goodwill I might have had for the author after reading Annihilation was siphoned away by the other two novels in the series.
