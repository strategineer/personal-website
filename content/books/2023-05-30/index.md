I guess this is what happens when a tremendously successful author with a single published novel to her name spends 16 years writing another one.

I read Susanna Clarke's first novel, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel, when I was a kid and, now, I've forgotten what it was about and if I enjoyed it (or not).

After reading Piranesi, I'm unlikely to forget this one and how I felt reading through it.
