A heartfelt high school rom-com about virginity from the perspective of five girls.

A lot of bold choices and story beats that I've never seen tackled in a manga/anime. Mostly, they're successful and interesting except for one character/"love interest" in particular.

I watched the anime dubbed and I read the manga after. Both were written by Mari Okada and so they're extremely faithful to each other.

The translations are different of course with only minor differences made to the story/visuals itself. I'd recommend checking out either one.
