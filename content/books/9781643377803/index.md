Drawn by French artist Moebius and written by Jodorowsky himself, every page of the Incal is an opportunity for the pair to blow you away with the prettiest art you'll ever see and a humongous story told at a pace that's unbelievably fast and exciting.

Might be the coolest thing I've read in my entire life.

Jodorowsky's Dune which is a documentary about Joderowsky's famous attempt at making a filmic adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune. After watching that I knew that Jodorowsky was definitely someone to keep an eye on.

It seems as though The Incal is where a lot of his creative energy went after his Dune adaption failed to materialize.

I think the world is better for it.
