Reading Rejection feels like watching a train crash but the train is you.

This is sort an anthology with a strong enough thematic connective tissue that I actually like it. Wild.

- weaponized crippling loneliness
- I don't believe that "Hell is other people" but the POV characters in Rejection are, some tragically some less so, Hell.
- *reductio as absurdum* used as a sledgehammer to smash your soul into pieces by portraying something very real but exaggerated
- Rejection is a Horror novel and there are a couple jokes in here that sent me into laughing fits. This is writing
- linking the sections together with common characters and cameos is so good
- the term antisocial can't even begin to describe the headspaces Rejection puts us in
- one of the most soul crushing reads
- absolutely floored by this, the number of paragraphs in this novel that are extremely accurate, cutting, specific reads that decked me repeatedly is criminal
