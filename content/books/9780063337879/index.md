Reading Rejection feels like watching a train crash but the train is you.


<!--more-->

This is sort an anthology with a strong enough thematic connective tissue that I actually like it. Wild.

- weaponized crippling loneliness
- I don't believe that "Hell is other people" but the POV characters in Rejection are, some tragically some less so, Hell.
- *reductio as absurdum* used as a sledgehammer to smash your soul into pieces by portraying something very real but exaggerated
