It's got some undeniably funny and prescient parts (like the narrator taking the piss out of a transition towards touchscreens/gestures when physical buttons work just fine) but overall the novel doesn't hold up.

The references to Gengus Khan and "racial mixing" in the first are offensive and, more importantly, not even funny.
