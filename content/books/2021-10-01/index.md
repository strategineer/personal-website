title: Infrastructure - A Guide To The Industrial Landscape
---

Infrastructure is a guide to all the major \"ecosystems\" of our modern
industrial world. In exploring railroad tracks, antenna towers, highway
overpasses, power lines, coal mines, nuclear power plants, grain elevators, oil
refineries, steel mills, and more, Brian Hayes reveals how our familiar and
often-overlooked industrial environment can be as dazzling as nature.

Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the Industrial Landscape is exactly what you
think it is and it's amazing. It's a book that covers anything that you could
consider to be "Infrastructure" (water treatment, electricity, farming, cargo
ships, airplanes, mining, etc.) and gives you a broad yet deep understanding of
how it all works through clear writing and beautiful photos taken by the author
himself.

After reading Infrastructure, I now have a better understanding of all the
infrastructure that surrounds me and this knowledge prevents me from taking
anything for granted. I now know what others needed to build (and need to
maintain) for me to be able to flip a light switch on and off or pour myself a
glass of water.
