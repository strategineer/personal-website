"We mustn't run short of filmbase," the Duke said. "Else, how could we
flood village and city with our information? The people must learn how
well I govern them. How would they know if we didn't tell them?"

It's Dune. It's aged surprisingly well. It has a lot to say about the world of today on the verge of collapse due to the destruction of our climate, poorly thought through technology, rampant late capitalism and the ever enticing venus flytrap of ideology.

Having watched both Dune by David Lynch as well as Dune Part One by Denis Villeneuve, I feel that although both are quite interesting and good (yes, even the David Lynch movie) in their own way, Dune is a story best told through the medium of the novel, by adapting Dune into a movie you lose a lot of what makes Dune interesting.

Maybe if Jodorowsky had been able to achieve his vision of a 15 hour long movie adaptation of Dune, I'd feel differently... but here we are.
