I really loved it...

I was skeptical at first (I've been burned too many times by boring and tropey fantasy novels that so many people love) but V. E. Schwab reeled me in with some gritty and edgy fantasy that felt really "real" to me.

I was so immersed in the world that I was tearing up by the end of the book which doesn't happen to me very often (one character's arc really spoke to me)

I can't wait to read the rest of novels in this series, here's hoping that they're just as good as this one if not better.
