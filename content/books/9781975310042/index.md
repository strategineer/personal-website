- Amazing first half, an absolute masterclass in making manga with meaningful and interesting dilemmas using the medium to convey love, loss, wonder, humor. Followed by a less stellar second half, the story slows down in a big way, there's very little conflict to push the story forward. More time spent zooming in on Hachiken's classmates struggles rather than following his small business/entrepreneur project would've been much more interesting and appropriate follow up than what we got. 
- A big tear jerker but in a genuine way. Very little melodrama just the struggle to find meaning and purpose in your life. 
- Especially early on, the Buddhist ideology is hard to avoid (there's a character who looks like normal depictions of Bhudda)
