Silver Spoon is:
- A manga by Hiromu Arakawa (known for hew work on Full Metal Alchemist) with an especially amazing first half. It's an absolute masterclass in writing/drawing manga that goes way beyond just providing you with a drip-feed of cheap thrills like a lot of manga does. It's followed by a less stellar second half, the story slows down in a big way, there's very little conflict to push the story forward. I would have preferred for Arakawa to spend more time zooming in on Hachiken's classmates struggles, like we did for him in the first half of the series, rather than continuing the story with a "becoming a small business owner" arc.
- A big tear jerker but in a genuine way. There's very little melodrama. The drawings are used masterfully in combination with the words on the page to bring the characters's thoughts and emotions to life. 
- Thematically:
  - about meaning---the struggle to find it in your life.
  - about trauma---recognizing its lasting consequences on you and its impact on your behaviour and what to do about it.
  - about community---leaning on it when you need to and contributing to it for the good of everyone.
  - about privilege---not taking it for granted and leveraging it to help make the world a better place.
- Filled with Buddhist themes.
