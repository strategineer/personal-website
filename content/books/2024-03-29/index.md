A Memory Called Empire has big "Hugo award winner" energy: an interesting premise, consistent and intriguing world building, a promising start and a propulsive ending.

I loved my time with it and very excited to dig into the next book in the series although I suspect that it won't be as good.

[I can confirm the second book was not as good. In fact, I think it's a trashfire.](/books/2024-04-11)
