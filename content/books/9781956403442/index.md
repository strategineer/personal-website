title: Game Master's Handbook of Proactive Roleplaying

This seems like a whole book digging into a version of the Beat system from the {{< book_url "Heart - The City Beneath" >}} RPG with the serial numbers filed off.

Using goals set by players to help guide the GM's hand towards building the kinds of roleplaying experiences and character beats that the players want their characters to have is genius and writing a whole book about how to maximize the effectiveness of this tool makes sense.

But moving forward I'll be sure to make this goal setting process an explicit part of the character creation process and end of session wrap-up in my campaigns because I've had mixed results when I've given the opportunity to do this but not forced it.
