Sad/mad gay wizards doing sad/mad gay wizard things. Very grim... There are a bunch of Herald Mages running around at the start of this series which begs the question: "What's going to happen to all of the Herald Mages?"

...

I'm sad to inform my earlier self that nothing interesting happens to those Herald-Mages (they get killed by a rando mage). The way that no one acknowledges that there are only 3 Herald-Mages left when the fourth dies is wild. And then when Savil and Vanyel are the only two Herald-Mages left and Savil asks for Vanyel's help protecting herself and he brushes her off, it's so stupid.

This isn't the sort of book I would have chosen to read of my own volition and reading through it hasn't convinced me to read more Lackey moving forward.

It's not all bad but so little of this works for me and the depiction of Vanyel is so offensive at times that I just can't with this trilogy.
