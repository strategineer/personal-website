A man dies and is reborn over and over again retaining the memories of his past lives. He's not alone. Hijinks ensue.

The narratorial voice is on point. Harry sounds like someone who's lived for hundreds of years. That's a big part of what makes this novel so gripping.

The novel feels inspired by Ted Chiang's short story *Understand*. But instead of a medical doodad of some kind granting the protagonist (way) above average intelligence, Harry is able to get through his many lives with ease because he knows the future and he's lived through and remembered each of his previous lives.

He's a time vampire!

**Minor spoilers ahead**

It's a shame that only Harry and one other Kalachakra (people who relive their lives over and over again) are also Ouroboran (Kalachakras who can perfectly recall their past lives). They are very very special people and at the end of the day they're the only people who really matter in the story. Every other human being and Kalachakra is mostly along for the ride.

This conceit allows for Claire North to put most of her focus on the many lives of both of these main characters but it feels a little arbitrary. The entire novel is built on this shakey foundation, and when both of these characters's Ouroboran-ness becomes more and more a key  is a key part of the story.

**Thoughts on the author**

If you get an old copy of the book like I did, you might be surprised to read the author's blurb which says that this is Claire North's first novel.

Technically, that's true. But Claire North is a pseudonym of Catherine Webb. By the time The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August was published, Webb had spent at least 14 years of her life writing and being published.

This novel does NOT read like someone's first novel because it isn't.

Given her experience and the quality of her writing, it's a real shame that Claire North's work isn't more popular.
