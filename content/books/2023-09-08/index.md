title: Good Thinking - Why Flawed Logic Puts Us All At Risk And How Critical Thinking Can Save The World
---

A compelling and instructive book on the many logical fallacies we are guilty of committing ourselves and exposed to through the media and internet.

A book that made me feel as though it was written specifically for me. A must read book that very few people will read.
