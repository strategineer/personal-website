In Screaming Planet, Jodorowsky collaborates with artists recommended to him by his publisher on short comics with 10 pages or less very loosely related to a flaming planetary object flying through space. The art styles of each short comic are varied as you can imagine, and some are surprisingly good.

In the foreword, Jodorowsky explains a bit about his process. He says that he tries to tell stories that fit with the artists's strengths and interests. He says says that he's been going this his entire career. For example, John Difool from the Incal has a bit of Moebius in him.
