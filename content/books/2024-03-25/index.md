I'm not sure who to blame for how boring most of this book is:

- The British for their empire and the consequences of that on the Irish
- The Catholics for influencing the Irish and warping their existing folkloric beliefs
- Lady Wylde herself for presenting these stories in a very blunt and uninteresting way.

All of the above?

All I know is that I DNF this one at around the 70% mark, life's too short. I need to become more comfortable with dropping a book if it's not good enough and lowering my "shitty book" threshold.
