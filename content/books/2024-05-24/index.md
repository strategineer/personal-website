A recommendation by Adrian Tchaikovsky himself, let's see how it goes.

Oof but I'm intrigued. Summoning a mythological lion (God? a god?) and having it lick the protagonist in what seems to be a historical medieval fantasy story was pretty wild. Starting a book with a violent rape of a child followed by her murdering both of her assailants was wild. I don't know what I was expecting from this text before reading it but it wasn't this.

like wtf is going on here. The mix and match between extremely grounded medieval historical fiction and the fantasy is cool. 

I LOVE a good frame story. The historian losing his shit over previously historical documents being categorized as fiction is great. Some real Knights Templar / AssCreed shit, conspiracy shit. 

That's cool but then Ash's story cool AF with a healthy dose rollercoaster ride action sequences, suspense, surprises, intrigue, all wrapped in what feels like an authentic-ish medieval war story told from an interesting POV.

I am continuing to be amazed by Mary Gentle's ability to combine the mundane reality of running a mercenary company in the late 1400s with the fantasy scenes of 500 priests praying and manifesting a blizzard, a Jewish curse making the Sun disappear from an entire part of the world, Ash's ability to communicate with, essentially, a computer versed in military tactics.

The mundanity makes the fantastic more believable somehow. 

Also, Ash is not a stereotypical protagonist. Mary Gentle consistently subverts some of the tropes you might expect to see throughout the text. Ash is not a chosen one, she's special in some ways but not in others.

Initially she is portrayed as being very special and touched by God, a prophet of battle of sorts. But gradually this shifts as our understanding of the world Ash exists in is deepened. My perception of her shifted and made me think that isn't special or fated for great things,  she's just a product of her upbringing and her genes
