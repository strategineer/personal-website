spoilers-ish for the basic premise:

{{< spoiler >}}
This book focuses on childhood trauma and how our memories of the past deteriorate over time naturally and sometimes change completely because our brain suppresses traumatic memories we can't handle.

I'm not exactly sure how this process works but it's real and tough to deal with because two people can remember the same event very differently and how do we handle that?

This book takes this premise to an extreme but the malleability of memories are a universal human struggle that the author is playing with in interesting ways in this novel that I really enjoyed sinking my teeth into.
{{< /spoiler >}}

A well-executed novel that does what it sets out to do and engages with themes surrounding suppressed traumatic memories which are particularly poignant for me right now.

Also it's a breeze to read through and doesn't waste your time which I appreciated.
