spoilers-ish for the basic premise:

{{< spoiler >}}
This book focuses on childhood trauma and how our memories of the past deteriorate over time naturally and sometimes change completely because our brain suppresses traumatic memories we can't handle.

I'm not exactly sure how this process works but it's real and tough to deal with because two people can remember the same event very differently and how do we deal with that?

This book takes this premise to the extreme but the malleability of memories are a universal human issue that the author is playing with in interesting ways in this novel.
{{< /spoiler >}}

A very well-executed novel that does what it sets out to do and also engages with themes surrounding suppressed traumatic memories which is particularly poignant for me right now.
