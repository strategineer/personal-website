Gorgeous art by Dongzi Liu can't save the horrendous writing by Jodorowsky. The extremely taboo and fucked up premise for this is one thing, but I'll read a story about anything. It's just so bad.

I cannot begin to imagine what sort of circumstances would have led to the production of this comic. That's the story I want to read about.
