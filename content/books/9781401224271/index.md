This comic book was first published in 2002 by a Pro-Israel author. Fables is explicitly an allegory for the Isreal-Palestinian conflict. So I'm expecting more than a little yikes with a dash of Islamophobia in this comic book so let's see how far we get.

1 volume into it so far and I'm curious to see what happens next. It's nice to read through a comic book that, so far, is much more compressed than the Berserk manga I just finished. We're not luxuriating in chapter after chapter of every single movement a guy makes as he's slicing through a horde of demons. Instead, in Fables, and American comics more broadly, we zoom in on interesting scenes and skip over the details.

There's a place for both compressed and decompressed art depicting moments in time like comic books and manga. But after reading through 41 volumes of hyper decompressed manga, I need a break!
