title: "Refried Beanies"
date: 2025-03-04
food/tags:
  - tried-and-true
servings: 8
tools:
  - large dutch oven (or pot)
  - chef's knife for chopping and dicing
  - spatula for stirring
  - machador (bean masher) (or use the spatula) 
  - pressure cooker
ingredients:
  - 2-4 tbsp [Mexican seasoning](https://www.food.com/recipe/mexican-seasoning-mix-456146)
  - 2 cups dried pinto beans soaked in water overnight
  - 1 tbsp virgin olive oil
  - 226g yellow onions (1 large onion or 2 small onions), finely chopped
  - 2-4 jalapeño peppers, finely chopped
  - 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
  - 1 lbs of bacon or sausage, sliced (smaller pieces are better)
  - 1 lime
steps:
  - Cook the pinto beans in a pressure cooker (read the manual but 2-3 minutes at default settings should work well). Let the pressure release naturally to avoid making a mess. Optionally, cook the beans the day before, store them in the fridge and then take them out when needed below (this'll make them easier to smash). 
  - In a large dutch oven (or a pot), cook the onion and jalapeño peppers in the virgin olive oil at medium-high heat until they become soft and the onions become semi-translucent. Season with salt and pepper.
  - Add the meat, and brown thoroughly (you shouldn't be able to see any pink meat).
  - Add the garlic and Mexican seasoning, strirring often, cook for 2 more minutes.
  - Add the beans to the pot. Smash them with the machador (or your spatula). 
  - Once the beans are smashed, stir constantly, scraping the bottom of the pot with the spatula until refried beans have achieved the desired level of dryness (you should be able to move your spatula along the bottom of the pan and the beans shouldn't be liquid enough to in to fill the void).
  - Squeeze lime juice into the pot, mix.
  - Taste and adjust the seasoning.
  - Serve with rice or in tortillas with cheese, salsa and guacomole.
  - Any leftovers can be frozen in pyrex containers or plastic freezer bags. Eat within 3+ months ideally.
