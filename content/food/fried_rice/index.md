ingredients:
  - 1 eggs (whisked)
  - 2 spring onions (use the 2 greens but only 1 white)
  - a pinch of salt
  - a tiny pinch of sugar
  - 1 tbsp of neutral oil ( plus a few more to coat the pan before you start)
  - ~250g of steamed rice
  - a few squirts of light soy sauce
  - a 9" cast iron skillet
  - a spatula
steps:
  - Get the pan to medium heat. Leave the skillet for a few minutes, for it to accumulate heat.
  - Coat the pan generously with oil, make sure the skillet is nicely coated. Get that oil out in a container to reuse for that same purpose later.
  - Add 1 tbsp of fresh oil to the pan.
  - Drop the eggs in, and stir it vigorously. It should blend in, almost emulsify with the oil in the pan.
  - Drop the rice before the egg is fully set.
  - Don't lift the pan. Use your spatula to break lumps gently, spread the rice, and then flip it on itself. Repeat.
  - When the rice starts dancing, add the seasoning, add the white part of the onions. Stir a little.
  - Crank the heat up to the max.
  - Drop the soy. Stir. Stir. Stir. Green part of onions. Stir. Stir. Stir. No more than a minute total.
  - Off the heat. Little more green spring onions on it. Eat asap.
