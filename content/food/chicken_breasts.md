  - Preheat oven to 425F/220C (392F/200C using a convection oven).
  - Pound chicken to 1.5cm / 0.6" at the thickest part - using a fucking hammer
    mate (for even cooking and tender chicken).
  - Mix all the dry ingredients together in a bowl, this is the seasoning.
  - Line tray with foil or parchment paper. Place breasts on tray. Drizzle
    chicken with about 1 tsp of olive oil. Rub over with fingers. Sprinkle with
    seasoning.

    sprinkle with seasoning, covering as much of the surface area as you can.

    165F/75C.
  - Remove breasts from oven and immediately transfer them to plates.
  - Wait 3 - 5 minutes before serving.
