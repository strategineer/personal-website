blurb: Breaded Chicken
servings: 6-8
ingredients:
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired
  - 6 chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise (butterflied)
  - salt and ground black pepper to taste
  - Â¾ cup all-purpose flour
  - 1 tablespoon paprika
  - 2 eggs, beaten
  - 2 cups seasoned bread crumbs (or panko)
steps:
  - Preheat oven to 425F/220C. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper drizzled with olive oil.
  - Flatten chicken breasts (and tenders) to 1/4-inch thickness. Season chicken with salt and pepper.
  - Mix flour and paprika together on a large plate. Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. Mix bread crumbs together on a separate large plate.
  - Dip each chicken piece in flour mixture, then egg, and then bread crumbs mixture and set aside in 1 layer on a clean plate. Repeat with remaining chicken. (Tip: Manipulate dry ingredients with one hand and the wet ingredients with the other).
  - Arrange chicken on the sheet. Drizzle olive oil over each piece of chicken.
  - Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue baking until no longer pink in the center and the breading is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165F/74C.
