blurb: ...
servings: 1
ingredients:
  - "1x Big Tortilla (about 11in / 28cm or bigger)"
  - "Some good quesadilla cheese (you'll know it when you see it but I recommend marble cheddar)"
  - "Fresh salsa (chopped onion, chopped tomato, chopped jalapenos, salt, mix it all up then add some olive oil then mix it all up again)"
  - "Scrambled eggs (put worcestershire sauce in the egg before you scramble them)"
  - "[Optional] [Guacamole](/food/guacamole)"
steps:
  - Put the tortilla on a plate and then a reasonable amount of cheese in the middle of it.
  - Throw the plate in the microwave for a min or two until it's reasonably melted.
  - Spread scrambled eggs, salsa, guacamole on top of the melted cheese.
  - Use your big brain and wrap the end of it with one hand so that the insides don't fall out of the tortilla while you eat it from the other side.
