food/tags:
  - tried-and-true
summary: my chili recipe, it's very dense (and tasty).
servings: 8
tools:
  - large dutch oven (or pot)
  - chef's knife for chopping and dicing
  - spatula for stirring
  - ladle for serving/storing
  - "[optional] pressure cooker"
ingredients:
  - 4-8 tbsp [Mexican seasoning](https://www.food.com/recipe/mexican-seasoning-mix-456146)
  - 2 cups dried black beans (or red kidney or pinto) soaked in water overnight
  - 1 tbsp virgin olive oil
  - 226g yellow onions (1 large onion or 2 small onions), finely chopped
  - 4-8 jalapeño peppers, finely chopped
  - 8 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
  - 340g carrots (~2-3), peeled, sliced (1/4 disks)
  - 1 kg ground beef
  - 2 x 28 oz (798 ml) diced **roma** tomato cans
  - ~2-3 cups of beef broth (depends on desired chili thickness)
  - tortilla chips
  - sour cream
  - cheddar cheese, shredded
steps:
  - Cook the beans quickly in a pressure cooker, or slowly in a pot ([don't poison yourself!](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/food-safety/chemical-contaminants/natural-toxins/lectins-legumes.html)) or use canned beans (drained and rinsed).
  - In a large dutch oven (or a pot), cook the onion, jalapeño peppers and carrots in the virgin olive oil at medium-high heat until they become soft and the onions become semi-translucent. Season with salt and pepper.
  - Add the ground beef, breaking it up into small pieces and brown thoroughly (you shouldn't be able to see any pink meat).
  - Add the garlic and Mexican seasoning, strirring often, cook for 2 more minutes.
  - Add the remaining ingredients, including the beans, mixing them into the chili and bring it to a boil over high heat.
  - Once boiling, reduce heat to low-medium. Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until chili thickens (thicker than soup but thinner than yogurt).
  - Taste and adjust the seasoning as the chili thickens.
  - Serve in small bowls with cheese and sour cream on top, and tortilla chips alongside for dipping.
  - Any leftovers can be frozen in pyrex containers or plastic freezer bags. Eat within 3+ months ideally.
