title: "Black Hole Chili"
date: 2025-02-14
food/tags:
  - tried-and-true
summary: my chili recipe, it's very dense (and tasty).
servings: 8
tools:
  - large dutch oven (or pot)
  - large stainless steel pan
  - chef's knife for chopping and dicing
  - spatula for stirring
  - ladle for serving/storing
  - "[optional] pressure cooker"
ingredients:
  - 4-8 tbsp [Mexican seasoning](https://www.food.com/recipe/mexican-seasoning-mix-456146)
  - 2 cups dried black beans (or red kidney or pinto) soaked in water overnight
  - 1 tbsp virgin olive oil
  - 226g yellow onions (1 large onion or 2 small onions), finely chopped
  - 4-8 jalapeño peppers, finely chopped
  - 8 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
  - 340g carrots (~2-3), peeled, sliced (1/4 disks)
  - 1 kg ground beef
  - 2 x 28 oz (798 ml) diced **non-plum** tomato cans
  - ~2-3 cups of beef broth (depends on desired chili thickness)
  - salt, pepper and MSG to taste.
  - tortilla chips
  - sour cream
  - cheddar cheese, shredded
steps:
  - Cook the beans quickly in a pressure cooker, or slowly in a pot ([don't poison yourself!](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/food-safety/chemical-contaminants/natural-toxins/lectins-legumes.html)) or use canned beans (drained and rinsed).
  - In a large dutch oven (or a pot), cook the onion, jalapeño peppers and carrots in the virgin olive oil at medium-high heat until they become soft and the onions become semi-translucent. Season with salt, pepper and MSG (a pinch of MSG is enough).
  - In a large stainless steel pan, add the ground beef, breaking it up into small pieces and brown thoroughly (you shouldn't be able to see any pink meat). Once browned, pour out the fat and set the meat aside.
  - Add the garlic and Mexican seasoning, strirring often, cook for 2 more minutes.
  - Add the remaining ingredients, including the meat and the beans, into the dutch oven, mixing them into the chili and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat.
  - Once boiling, reduce heat to low-medium. Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until chili thickens (thicker than soup but thinner than yogurt).
  - Taste and adjust the seasoning as the chili thickens.
  - Serve in small bowls with cheese and sour cream on top, and tortilla chips alongside for dipping.
  - Any leftovers can be frozen in pyrex containers or plastic freezer bags. Eat within 3+ months ideally.
