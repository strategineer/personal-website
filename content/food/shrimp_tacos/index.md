blurb: Spice up your life with spicy shrimp tacos.
servings: 4
ingredients:
  - ~1 lbs shrimp (any sized shrimp will do but I prefer the larger ones)
  - 1 1/2 tablespoon Taco seasoning
  - 2 teaspoons olive oil
  - 1 lime (juiced)
  - 2 tomatoes (diced)
  - 1-2 onions (diced)
  - 4 romaine lettuce leaves (sliced)
  - 1/2 bunch cilantro (or use Italian parsley)
  - 1 lime (quartered)
  - 1 jalapeno (optional)
  - 1 guacamole recipe
  - 4 large tortillas (~11″)
steps:
  - Place the shrimp in a medium bowl, toss with the olive oil and lime juice, then add 1 1/2 tablespoons of the taco spice blend and mix to coat throughly. Allow the shrimp to stand and marinate at room temperature for 20-30 minutes.
  - While the shrimp are marinating, prep your veggie add-ins and make the guacamole. Chop the tomatoes, chop the onions, slice the lettuce thin, chop the cilantro fine and quarter the limes to squeeze on the tacos. Slice the jalapeño crosswise into thin rings, if using.
  - When shrimp are done marinating, you can cook them on medium heat using a non-stick fry pan.
  - Warm the tortillas, then lay them flat on plates, one per person. Top with the guacamole, then layer on shrimp, tomato, onion, lettuce, and cilantro. Serve tacos with lime wedges to squeeze over the top. Add jalapeños, if using.
