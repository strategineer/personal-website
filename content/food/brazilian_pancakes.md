summary:
servings: 4
ingredients:
  - 1.5 cup (375mL) of milk
  - 3 eggs
  - 1 tablespoon of oil
  - 1 teaspoon of salt
  - 0.5 cup of corn starch (sorry, didn't weight it ...)
  - 1.5 cup of flour
  - 1 teaspoon (6g) of baking powder (optional)
  - dried onion / 1 small onion, diced (optional)
steps:
  - Throw everything in a blender but the baking powder, adjust values until you get a batter that slides out of a spatula. It should be liquid, a bit thicker than a crepe batter, but definitely less thick than a pancake batter.
  - After that, mix in the baking powder. Pour the batter in a bowl.
  - Put a bit of oil in a large, non-stick skillet. Let it heat. When it's hot, take the pan out, put a ladle of the batter on it and move it to spread the batter. When the borders start to get a bit golden, flip it.
  - The first one will be horrible, but you can use it adapt the heat, amount of batter, and maybe the salt and thickness.
  - Then the filling is whatever you want. The classic one is with minced meat, but ham and cheese works too. Normally it's served with tomato sauce over it, and you can reheat it in an oven with some cheese.

- It freezes really well after it's assembled - just don't freeze it with the sauce, it'll get soggy.
- The recipe is really flexible: I used 2 eggs instead of 3 this time, and added a bit more of salt. You can also do sweet ones, just use less salt. And, well, skip the onions.
