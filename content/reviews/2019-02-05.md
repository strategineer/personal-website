Paratopic is a spooky PS1/lofi horror experience. Its use of lofi weird graphics, its soundtrack and the story all work in unison to make you feel extremely uncomfortable and unsettled whilst playing the game. I enjoy concise and short experiences however Paratopic feels shorter than it deserves to be and thus left me wanting more.
