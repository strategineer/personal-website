outro: "I highly recommend playing Open Sorcery if you're interested in short experimental games with unique premises."

In Open Sorcery you play as BEL/S v5.6 an elemental spirit of fire bound to C++ code charged with protecting her environment (a school, an old folk's home and her creators's homes) from various spiritual beings by her creators.

Open Sorcery is a short (1h) but replayable game with a unique and well realized premise with a highly branching storyline, many secrets to uncover and beings to discover and connect with or burn with fire.
