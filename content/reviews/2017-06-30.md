pros:
  - "Controlling Noodle is a unique and fun experience and learning to control
    him well is very rewarding."
  - "Gameplay is quite simple and relaxing consisting of you exploring a level,
    solving environmental puzzles and performing cool moves to collect
    collectables."
  - "Additional obstacles and puzzle elements are added over the course of the
    game which keeps the game interesting as you go along."
  - "Art is cartoony and clean."
cons:
  - "Music is okay but can get quite repetitive because the same songs will end
    up looping each for an hour or two."
outro:
  "If you're looking to play a relaxing and rewarding platformer with a unique
  control scheme then you can hardly go wrong with Snake Pass."

In Snake Pass, you play the role of Noodle, a lazy snake basking in the sun when
suddenly he must go on an adventure to save the world.

Snake Pass is an old school collect-a-thon platformer where you control a snake.
