pros:
    - "Plot keeps you on your toes the entire way through and pushes you forward."
    - "Combat is fun due to the number of different enemies and different approaches for tackling them."
    - "Exploration is enjoyable and rewarding due to the well-designed environments filled with well-presented environmental storytelling."
    - "The crafting system matters, it keeps you excited scavenging for resources and encourages you to explore every nook and cranny."
    - "Visuals are great, there's a lot of interesting stuff to see, specifically the near-future tech and the enemies."
    - "Moving and fighting in no gravity zones (eg. space) is novel and feels really good."
cons:
    - "Micromanagement of inventory space early on is a bit of a hassle."
    - "Late in the game, upon entering a large area I experienced severe lag although previously everything was running smoothly (your experience may differ)."
outro: "If you enjoy immersive sims and/or science fiction then you'll most likely enjoy your time spent with Prey."
