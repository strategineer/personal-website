In The Long Dark, you play as Will Mackenzie, a man trying to survive in the cold Canadian North after a plane crash leaves him stranded there in search of his passenger, Astrid, who seemingly fled the crash site in haste.

The Long Dark is a survival game with a narrative campaign and more freeform survival gameplay whereby you must survive in the harsh Canadian North for as long as possible.
