pros:
    - "Environments, enemies and bosses are numerous and diverse."
    - "Gameplay is fair but tough and encourages the player to min-max and fully explore the environments."
    - "Many different builds are viable, allowing the player to play the character they want to play."
    - "Difficulty can be tweaked to the player's preference by playing non-optimal builds."
    - "Great replay value (New Game+ and playing with different builds)."
    - "Fashion Souls."
cons:
    - "The art style, like a fine wine, is an acquired taste."
    - "No map of any kind means that early on, you will get lost a lot."

Salt and Sanctuary is a tough 2D Metroidvania-Soulslike game which is a love letter to everything we know and love from the Souls series of games.
