I will never [spoiler]I WAS JUST BATHING IN THE FEELING OF YOUR BODY[/spoiler] forget my experience with Doki Doki Literature Club, [spoiler]GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT[/spoiler] it might be the only game I've played [spoiler]EAGLES CAN FLY PEOPLE CAN TRY BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT[/spoiler] since To The Moon that successfully [spoiler]THE LIGHT FLICKERS I FLICKER BACK[/spoiler] made me feel something. It was a roller coaster [spoiler]IT'S RIGHT THERE HE'S RIGHT THERE[/spoiler] ride of emotions.

It's my GOTY for 2017 [spoiler]THE LADY WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING KNOWS WHAT I AM THINKING[/spoiler] and I'm not even joking. Must play.

Monika is best girl.
