pros:
    - "Gameplay is similar to L4D, and so it's great, but with an bigger emphasis on melee combat."
    - "The diversity of the loot, consisting of many different weapons, trinkets (passive buffs) and hats, keeps the game fresh and the players consistently coming back in the search for better loot."
    - "Guaranteed loot drops after every run coupled with the crafting system provides a great incentive to players to replay levels again and again which L4D lacked."
    - "Higher difficulty levels are tough but reward the player for playing them with better loot encouraging teamplay, coordination and minimal 'messing around' for shits and giggles even when playing with randos."
    - "Continuous support from the dev team has ensured the continuous addition of new content, accessible to all players, to the game including new levels and weapons to play with."
cons:
    - "..."

Warhammer: End Time - Vermintide is a masterpiece... and a L4D clone. It adds loot and hats to the proven L4D formula while setting the game in the Warhammer universe where Skaven (ratmen) are causing havoc and must be stopped.
