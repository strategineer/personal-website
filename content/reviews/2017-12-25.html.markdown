pros:
    - "Weird and unique."
    - "Visuals, effects, sounds and the commentary make you really feel as if you're playing the DVD commentary of a sci-fi B-movie."
    - "Well-executed humour that will make you smile."
    - "Voice acting is amazingly bad but in a good B-movie way."
    - "Gameplay is fun whether you're bashing man-apes on the head with a giant mace or shooting them with a ray gun."
    - "Climbing higher and higher on the tower over the course of the game is quite epic."
cons:
    - "I played the game relatively quickly and didn't go out of my way for collectibles but I beat the game in 3h."
outro: "If you like unique and weird games, if you're a fan of ACE Team (Rock of Ages, Zeno Clash, Abyss Odyssey), if you're a big fan of B-movies especially science fiction then you can hardly go wrong with the Deadly Tower of Monsters."

In the Deadly Tower of Monsters, you play as Dick Starspeed, a hero who's crash landed on the alien planet of Gravoria... Wait, actually you play as Jonathan Digby who's playing the role of Dick Starspeed in the movie the Deadly Tower of Monsters... Wait, actually you're playing as three different people in the DVD commentary of the Deadly Tower of Monsters by Dan Smith, the director of the movie, accompanied by an audio engineer Patrick.

The Deadly Tower of Monsters is a unique and weird action-adventure game that is an homage to old school B-movie sci-fi films, it is quite short but it more than makes up for it with the quality of the overall experience.
