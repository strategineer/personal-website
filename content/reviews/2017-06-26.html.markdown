In Octodad: Dadliest Catch, you play the role of Octodad who must go through his day to day life with his wife and kids and avoid being found out for what he truly is, an octopus.

Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a unique game that can be loosely described as an action-adventure/puzzle game with QWOP-like controls in 3D.
