pros:
    - "Good mix of modern, actiony behind the shoulder, and old school, survival / puzzle solving / methodical, Resident Evil gameplay that should appeal to a wide-range of players."
    - "Great asymmetric coop core gameplay with four different characters to play as, each of which plays quite differently from one another."
cons:
    - "Story is a little too &quot;out there&quot;, one could probably qualify it as being just plain bad."
    - "You get a good or a bad ending based on a excruciatingly small choice in one of the episodes, the bad ending is extremely anti-climatic compared to the good ending and having these two endings doesn't add anything to the game."
    - "Gameplay gets a tad repetitive towards the end of the fourth (and last real) episode due to the lack of enemy variety and new gameplay elements."
outro: "If you're a fan of the Resident Evil series or if you're looking for a fun horror coop game to play with a friend then you can't go wrong with Resident Evil Revelations 2."

In Resident Evil Revelations 2, you (and ideally another player) initially play as either Claire Redfield, Chris Redfield's sister, or Moira Burton, Barry Burton's daughter, who have been kidnapped at a TerraSave gathering (because &quot;Terr&quot; doesn't have to end with &quot;ist&quot;) and find themselves in a mysterious abandoned facility filled with monsters. Barry Burton, accompanied by a mysterious young girl named Natallia, follow in their tracks hoping to find out what happened to Claire and Moira.

Resident Evil Revelations 2 is a cooperative survival horror game which is a good mix of the old school and modern designs of the Resident Evil franchise.
