  - thumbs_up
pros:
  - "Very similar to the first Danganronpa game."
  - "Fun new character designs that will most likely grow on you."
  - "Murders are as outlandish and intriguing if not more so than the first
    game."
  - "Visuals and soundtrack are off the charts."
  - "Story goes through many twists and turns keeping you excited almost
    constantly."
cons:
  - "Very similar to the first Danganronpa game."
  - "Drags on at times (took me 40h to get through)."
  - "There's no option for adjusting auto text scroll speed (this is a basic
    feature for any VNs)."
outro:
  "If you really enjoyed the original Danganronpa then you will probably enjoy
  the sequel to a certain degree. However I recommend taking a break in between
  your playthroughs of both games because they are very similar and playing 80h
  of Danganronpa in a row isn't a good way to die."

Danganronpa 2 Goodbye Despair is a sequel to Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc
both of which are weird and very dark visual novel / adventure games featuring
talented school children who are forced into killing each other. The sequel is a
very similar game with new intrigue, new characters and some
additions/improvements to the existing gameplay mechanics.
