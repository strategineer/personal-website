tags: PC, thumbs_up
pros:
    - "Core gameplay loop consisting of avoiding enemies, shooting enemies, saving humans and handling secret side objectives encourages you to constantly move around in a deliberate way, like a dance, making for a dynamic and fulfilling experience."
    - "Gameplay is non-stop action from the start all the way to the end with no filler in between."
    - "Visuals are interesting to look at and are very readable, even when there are hundreds of enemies and bullets on screen."
    - "A light progression system with cosmetic unlocks and an impressive leaderboard system encourages players to replay levels in order to master them and get better high scores."
cons:
    - "If you have no intention of replaying levels in order to master them and achieve greater high scores, then you'll be done with all the content in the game in around two or three hours."

Nex Machina is a satisfying twin stick shooter with a well developed leaderboard system that feels like Doom (2016) but as a twin stick shooter.
