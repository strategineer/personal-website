pros:
    - "Gameplay is fair but challenging and requires a lot of thinking but also quick reflexes."
    - "Feudal Japan is the perfect setting for a modern evolution of this line of classic games."
    - "Each level forces you to make use of specific characters and as such keeps the gameplay fresh throughout."
    - "Great visuals that remind you of japanese paintings sort of (Okami-esque)."
    - "Instant panty drop for any true weeb."
cons:
    - "VO is great for the most part but sometimes it's not so good."
outro: "If you are a weeb or are interested in playing a great game inspired by the classic JA2/Commandos games then you can't go wrong with Shadow Tactics: Blade of the Shogun."
