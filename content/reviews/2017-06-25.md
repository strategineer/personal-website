pros:
    - "Tough but fair gameplay."
    - "Bosses are a blast to fight against and vary greatly in their design."
    - "Environments and characters are visually unique and interesting to look at."
    - "Story is intriguing and keeps you interested from fight to fight."
    - "Soundtrack is a great mix of tracks from different artists with a cohesive sound."
    - "VO is fully done in English, French and Japanese. I listened to the English VO and it was quite good."
cons:
    - "Some relatively important info isn't given the player (for example, pressing A in between boss fights will make the Stranger walk along the path to the next fight automatically, also, LB acts an alternative dodge button that is more optimal than the default A that is shown in the tutorial)."

In Furi, you play the role of a mysterious katana wielding prisoner named the Stranger who breaks out of his cell and ventures forth to fight his jailers, one by one.

Furi is a boss-rush character action game with a tough but fair difficulty curve, a visually intriguing world and a compelling story.
