pros:
  - "Unique and compelling man vs. (with?) nature experience that you can't find
    anywhere else."
  - "Getting a vehicle weighed down by logs stuck in mud (god forbid flipped
    over in mud) and having to tow it out is a slow, methodical but extremely
    tense and exciting experience like no other."
  - "Advanced terrain (mud, swamp, river, etc.) technologies bring the game to
    life visually but more importantly provide interesting gameplay challenges
    to overcome."
  - "Minimizing your impact on the environment (for example by avoiding certain
    terrain with very heavy vehicles to avoid creating muddier terrain, by not
    knocking over trees which can be used as tow points in times of need) is
    usually optimal over the long term encouraging you to think strategically
    and possibly philosophically."
cons:
  - "Eastern european jank specifically with regards to playing on a controller
    (most actions can be performed with a controller but not all requiring you
    to use the keyboard and mouse for certain rare but required actions)."
outro:
  "If you're interested in unique experiences, heavy duty vehicles or the
  Eastern European wilderness and are willing to look over some small annoyances
  if you're playing on a controller then you can't go wrong with Spintires."

WARNING: I've given a negative review of Spintires even though I find the game
to be truly unique and interesting based on the fact that the publisher of the
game is not paying the developer for his work and because the sequel to the game
Spintires: Mudrunner (with a different publisher who's paying the developer) is
a more polished and complete experience.

In Spintires you play a driver tasked with bringing lumber from point A to point
B in various muddy, forested, swampy and sometimes watery Eastern European
wilderness locations by making use of different heavy duty vehicles.

Spintires is a driving simulation game unlike many others with unique and
impressive technology for bringing the terrain to life visually and to provide
interesting gameplay challenges.
