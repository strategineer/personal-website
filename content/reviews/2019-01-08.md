pros:
    - "Intriguing mysteries/plot to unravel through the time traveling to freeze framed scenes of a person's death."
    - "Discovering the identity and fate of each crew member is extremely satisfying."
    - "Unique visuals of 3D black and white and 2D drawings combine to bring you into the historical context and render the violent scenes less gruesome."
cons:
    - "&quot;short&quot; at 5h but I enjoyed all of it and it did not overstay its welcome."
outro: "The Return of the Obra Dinn is an interesting experience that I would recommend to almost anybody but especially to people who like any of the following: mystery/detective novels or Zero Escape / Danganronpa."
