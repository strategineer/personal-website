pros:
    - "Experience feels straight out of Warhammer 40k or Aliens."
    - "Intense core gameplay loop; shooting aliens and exploring the derelict ship whilst the alien infestation drastically worsens each passing second."
    - "Incredible sound design, listening closely is necessary to prevent yourself from being eaten by an alien from behind."
    - "Upgrades acquired through play (kept until death) are randomly distributed which encourages more cooperation between players due to their different abilities."
cons:
    - "Mostly a one man dev team, clearly someone very competent, with a relatively slow and unstable update schedule."
outro: "If you're a fan of the Alien movie franchise and/or the Warhammer 40k universe or you're just looking for a unique coop game to play with friends then you can't go wrong with Space Beast Terror Fright."

In Space Beast Terror Fright, you play as a Space Marine entering randomly generated derelict space ships by yourself or with up to three other soldiers in which you must survive a constant onslaught of aliens whilst you navigate through the ship in order to blow it up to eliminate the alien menace and escape.

Space Beast Terror Fright is a methodical coop horror FPS heavily inspired by the movie Aliens and the Warhammer 40k universe.
