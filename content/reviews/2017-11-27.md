    - "Great integration of tutorials for a game with many unique gameplay elements."
    - "Visuals are outrageously stylish."

cons:
    - "Frustrating sometimes when the main character acts stupidly to make the story progress."
outro: "If you enjoy weird games, visual novels, the Zero Escape series and are not bothered by dark themes such as murder, suicide, etc. then you might enjoy Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc."

In Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc, you play as Makoto Naegi, a normal high school student who's just transferred to Hope's Peak Academy with several remarkably talented students. On his first day, he faints and wakes up to find that someone has trapped him and the other students inside the school, isolating them from the outside world. Will they be able to unravel the mysteries that surround them?

Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is a unique visual novel with a emphasis on investigations, relationships, rhythm game elements (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and dark themes. It is a well constructed but relatively linear experience that will appeal to people looking for unique experiences, mysteries and fans of Spike Chunsoft's other series Zero Escape.
