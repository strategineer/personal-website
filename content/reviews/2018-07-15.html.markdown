pros:
    - "Tough but fair on the hardest starting difficulty (with a healthy amount of checkpoints that serve to soften the blow during hard fights)."
    - "Certain initial plot elements are quite cliche but overall there is a lot of room for intrigue and excitement throughout the game."
    - "Satisfying combat encourages intelligent use of the many resources and tools at your disposal."
    - "Bosses are larger than life and memorable (think MGS series)."
    - "Non-linear sandboxy sections are placed in between more linear sections."
    - "Ending is a roller coaster and provides a great ending for the overall experience."
cons:
    - "Requires a relatively beefy PC to run well (check the minimum and recommended specs before buying)."

outro: "If you're interested in weird Japanese horror games, the Evil Within 2 does not disappoint."

The Evil Within 2 is a Japanese horror survival game with a cheesy semi serious story in an American setting. It's heavily inspired by Resident Evil (especially 4) and could be considered as a spiritual successor to that game.
