pros:
    - "Fixes a fundamental flaw with with most Total War games, specifically that campaigns never end, this is fixed by having continuously increasing stakes over the course of a campaign and a time limit gated by the progress of each race toward control over the Great Vortex."
    - "Magical spells and Warhammer's wide range of races and other creatures adds much needed spice to the regular Total War formula."
    - "Five different races to play with who are quite different from one another in both the strategic and tactical layers."
    - "Tutorial is amazing for newcomers to the series; it can be played with any race and acts as a seamless introduction to a real campaign."
    - "Amazingly crafted cinematics that put you in the mood and sells the fantasy perfectly."
    - "Beautiful visuals."
cons:
    - "Doesn't seem to be as well supported as the first game in terms of additional content and races; even though you can play with races from the first game, you can only do so in the &quot;Mortal Empires&quot; campaign which is a Total War paint-the-map style campaign which I personally can't go back to after experiencing the improved Total War Warhammer 2 &quot;Eye of the Vortex&quot; campaign."
outro: "If you're interested in good Total War games, if you are a fan of the Warhammer universe or a fan of the first game then you will most likely enjoy Total War Warhammer 2."
