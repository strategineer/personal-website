pros:
    - "Very similar to the first Danganronpa game."
    - "Fun new character designs that will most likely grow on you."
    - "Murders are as outlandish and intriguing if not more so than the first game."
    - "Visuals and soundtrack are off the charts."
    - "Story goes through many twists and turns keeping you excited almost constantly."
cons:
    - "Very similar to the first Danganronpa game."
    - "Drags on at times (took me 40h to get through)."
    - "There's no option for adjusting auto text scroll speed (this is a basic feature for any VNs)."
outro: "If you really enjoyed the original Danganronpa then you will probably enjoy the sequel to a certain degree. However I recommend taking a break in between your playthroughs of both games because they are very similar and playing 80h of Danganronpa in a row isn't a good way to die."

Danganronpa 2 Goodbye Despair is a sequel to Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc both of which are weird and very dark visual novel / adventure games featuring talented school children who are forced into killing each other. The sequel is a very similar game with new intrigue, new characters and some additions/improvements to the existing gameplay mechanics.
