pros:
    - "Rolling the boulder and avoiding obstacles placed by your opponent feels good and is easy to learn but hard to master."
    - "Placing defenses to stop and slow down your opponent's boulder is fun and requires a good amount strategy and tactics."
    - "Choosing your loading consisting of a choice of boulders and defenses at the start of a match allows you to focus on certain strategies depending on the level and on countering your opponent's choices."
    - "So much content; 15 levels that are truly different in how they play and look, 16 different boulders (most of which have unique characteristics and/or abilities) and 19 different defenses."
    - "Humour is expressed through the visuals, the voice acting and the gameplay and it's quite funny."
    - "Game can be enjoyed with a friend through the entire campaign locally and has various different modes of play locally and online."
cons:
    - "Campaign might be a little too easy if you're playing against the AI and you're really good at life/games. I recommend playing against friends in 1v1 (local or online) or 2v2 (online) matches."

Rock of Ages 2: Bigger and Boulder is a fun mix of Rolling Ball and Tower Defense genres of games and is quite unique concept that is well-executed and is a blast to play with friends.
