pros:
    - "Post apocalyptic setting is fresh and well-written."
    - "A lot of the dialogue is fully voiced."
    - "Core combat mechanics are solid."
cons:
    - "Game balance and economy are out of whack and easily gamed which detracts heavily from the experience."
    - "Gear is everything which makes levelups barely meaningful, especially as you progress through the game."
    - "Healing all your party members manually after every single battle is very tedious."
    - "Some skills are much more important than others but this isn't made obvious to the player thus allowing a player to easily make bad characters."
outro: "Wasteland 2 is a mediocre modern CRPG which pales in comparison to other more recent throwback CRPGs like Pillars of Eternity, Tyranny and Divinity: Original Sin and so if you're looking to play one of these kinds of games I'd suggest you look at those. If you're a big fan of CRPGs and the post apocalyptic setting then I'd suggest you try it out but don't expect to come away from the experience fully satisfied."

Wasteland 2 is an interesting but unbalanced and dated CRPG in a post apocalyptic setting. It is a sequel to Wasteland, the game which inspired Fallout.
