  - thumbs_up
pros:
  - "Extremely polished."
  - "Extremely high skill ceiling."
  - "Gameplay is demanding when you want to play well, a thinking man's game."
  - "The draft mode can be played for free unlike any other digital card game on
    the market."
  - "Cards have real (Steam Wallet) monetary value (I've made 250$ so far just
    by playing the game)."
  - "Fully voiced flavor/lore text for each card."
cons:
  - "Constructed play is significantly inferior to draft play although this
    hopefully will be remedied when new sets of cards are released."
outro:
  "I'd recommend Artifact to anyone and everyone interested in a deep and
  interesting competitive card game."
