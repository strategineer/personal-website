pros:
    - "Extremely polished."
    - "Extremely high skill ceiling."
    - "Gameplay is demanding when you want to play well, a thinking man's game."
    - "The draft mode can be played for free unlike any other digital card game on the market."
    - "Cards have real (Steam Wallet) monetary value (I've made 250$ so far just by playing the game)."
    - "Fully voiced flavor/lore text for each card."
cons:
    - "Constructed play is significantly inferior to draft play although this hopefully will be remedied when new sets of cards are released."
outro: "I'd recommend Artifact to anyone and everyone interested in a deep and interesting competitive card game."
