pros:
  - "Sandbox gameplay is fun for a little while."
  - "Traversal is better than ever: maneuvering around the world using the grappling hook, parachute, wingsuit and especially the jetpack (DLC) is tons of fun."
  - "Collectible locations are revealed when you fully clear out an area which removes some tedium from their collecting them."
cons:
  - "Open world isn't very compelling, it's big but relatively sparse, content-wise, every region to liberate is unique but not in ways that matter."
  - "Gameplay doesn't evolve enough as you progress through the game (most gadgets and mods are acquired early and don't change the core gameplay much)."
  - "Gameplay becomes tedious and you'll be tired of it long before you clear out all the areas in the game."
  - "Driving land vehicles feels pretty bad compared to other similar games."
outro: "I've completed maybe 1/4 of the game but I feel like I've already seen everything the game has to offer. If you're interested in this game and/or have enjoyed previous games in the series, maybe pick this one up on sale and see for yourself although don't expect a life-changing experience."

In Just Cause 3, you play as Rico Rodriguez returning to his homeland of Medici in order to aid the rebels to overthrow the dictactor, General Sebastiano Di Ravello, in control of the country.

Just Cause 3 is an open world action game whereby you'll be flying around and blowing red stuff up... Which is fun for a couple hours but quickly becomes tedious primarily because nothing that matters changes as you progress through the game.
