pros:
    - "Mix of action / puzzle gameplay makes you work your brain."
    - "Tons of surprises and some extremely memorable set pieces."
    - "Figuring out the most efficient way of getting from point A to point B has never been so exhilarating."
    - "Game remains fun on subsequent playthroughs by having many &quot;easy to learn but hard to master&quot; gameplay elements such as how to deal with each enemy/boss effectively."
    - "Gorgeous visuals."
cons:
    - "I've beaten the game around eight times and I've truly enjoyed each moment I've spent with the game. However, if you only want to play through the game's &quot;unique&quot; content once then you'll most likely spend ten to sixteen hours with the game in total which is something to be considered due to the game's price."
outro: "If you're a fan of the Resident Evil franchise or if you're looking for a great survival horror game then you can't go wrong with Resident Evil 2 (2019).  "
