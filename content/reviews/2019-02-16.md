pros:
    - "Mix of action / puzzle gameplay makes you work your brain."
    - "Tons of surprises and some extremely memorable set pieces."
    - "Figuring out the most efficient way of getting from point A to point B has never been so exhilarating."
    - "Game remains fun on subsequent playthroughs by having many &quot;easy to learn but hard to master&quot; gameplay elements such as how to deal with each enemy/boss effectively."
    - "Gorgeous visuals."
cons:
    - "I've beaten the game around eight times and I've truly enjoyed each moment I've spent with the game. However, if you only want to play through the game's &quot;unique&quot; content once then you'll most likely spend ten to sixteen hours with the game in total which is something to be considered due to the game's price."
outro: "If you're a fan of the Resident Evil franchise or if you're looking for a great survival horror game then you can't go wrong with Resident Evil 2 (2019).  "

In Resident Evil 2 (2019) you play as Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop on his first day on the job, or as Claire Redfield, Chris Redfield's sister searching for him, finding yourself trapped within the Raccoon City Police Station infested and surrounded by zombies, and other monstrosities, on all sides; you must find a way to escape.

Resident Evil 2 (2019) is a remake of the original Resident Evil 2 released in 1998 on the Playstation. It is a great survival horror third person game with light puzzle solving gameplay.
