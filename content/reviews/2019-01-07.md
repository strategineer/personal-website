pros:
    - "FPS gameplay felt good."
    - "Graphics are dated but in a nostalgic kind of way that feels authentic."
    - "We were laughing more often than not at the spooky parts but the laughter felt a little irrational (maybe we were actually very scared and contemplating the futility of existence)."
    - "Overall the game felt fair although the difficulty spiked a couple times throughout our playthrough."
cons:
    - "Built on the Half Life 1 engine, it is filled with jank such as: AI getting stuck on stairs and on death you lose your quick switch item keybinds."
outro: "I'd recommend checking out Cry of Fear with a friend in co-op if you like weird horror games, a decent challenge and are able to look past all the jank."
