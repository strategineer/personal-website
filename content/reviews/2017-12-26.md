    more than freeform survival gameplay to keep them engaged."

  wilderness then you can hardly go wrong with the Long Dark."

In The Long Dark, you play as Will Mackenzie, a man trying to survive in the
cold Canadian North after a plane crash leaves him stranded there in search of
his passenger, Astrid, who seemingly fled the crash site in haste.

The Long Dark is a survival game with a narrative campaign and more freeform
survival gameplay whereby you must survive in the harsh Canadian North for as
long as possible.
