pros:
    - "AAA Monster Hunter experience like we've never seen before."
    - "Fighting gigantic monsters makes you feel like a badass especially due to the modern AAA graphics and great art direction."
    - "Fourteen different weapons offer widely different playstyles and keep the gameplay when fresh."
    - "Lengthy (60h to beat the main quest for me) but rarely feels like a chore."
    - "Challenging end game content for hardcore fans that will keep you playing for hundreds of hours and will be extended through updates."
cons:
    - "Main quests cannot be easily played in coop otherwise coop works great."
    - "Some online connectivity issues, although I personally haven't experienced anything game breaking, only slight annoyances."
outro: "If you're a fan of the Monster Hunter series or if the game's premise seems interesting then you can't go wrong with Monster Hunter World."
