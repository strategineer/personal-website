pros:
    - "Exploring the beautiful, interesting and varied levels is enjoyable."
    - "Looking for and finding collectables is intrinsically fun because they are always useful."
    - "Equipping charms, items that grant passive abilities, allow you to customize your experience and allow you to optimize your 'build' for different situations."
    - "Fighting bosses, of which there are many, is a real challenge and quite rewarding once you beat them."
    - "Gaining abilities, most of which change the way you play traverse, fight and play the game is gratifying."
    - "Learning about the world and the overarching story is intriguing because it is well thought-out but cryptic and mysterious (reminds me a lot of Dark Souls)."
cons:
    - "Backtracking through the same areas multiple times may become a chore for some."
    - "Dying against bosses will happen sometimes but you'll rarely die from normal enemies or environmental hazards."

Hollow Knight is a great Metroidvania game with a pinch of Souls-like elements sprinkled in.
