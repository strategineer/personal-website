blurb: Very green but tastes very orangey. The gin combined with the two types of vermouth and the orange juice and liqueur gives this cocktail a unique flavor that's hard to describe.
ingredients:
  - 1/2 oz Tanqueray gin
  - 1/2 oz dry vermouth
  - 1/2 oz sweet vermouth
  - 1/2 oz fresh orange juice
  - 1/4 oz blue curaçao
  - 1 to 2 dashes of orange bitters
steps:
  - Shake and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

- This is a variation on the "curled" Satan's Whiskers cocktail which replaces the orange curaçao with blue curaçao because that's what I had at the time.
