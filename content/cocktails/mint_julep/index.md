summary: I don't like this drink.
ingredients:
  - 2 oz bourbon
  - 1 to 2 oz simple syrup
  - 5 or 6 stems of fresh mint, for garnish
steps:
  - Add crushed ice to a julep cup or collins glass until it is two-thirds full.
  - Add the bourbon and simple syrup and stir for 10 to 20 seconds.
  - Add more crushed ice and stir again until a thin layer of ice forms on the outside of the glass.
  - Add more crushed ice so that it domes slightly over the rim of the glass.
  - Garnish with the fresh mint stems and insert the straws.
  - Serve with a cocktail napkin to catch the condensation.
