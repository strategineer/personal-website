blurb: My homebrewed ginger beer recipe. It's really good. 
ingredients:
  - 1 gallon water
  - 3 thumb-sized piece organic ginger
  - 2 cups sugar (preferably brown)
  - 1/2 tbsp citric acid (or wine maker's acid blend or lime or lemon juice)
  - 1 tsp yeast nutrient (optional but recommended)
  - 1/8 tsp yeast
steps:
  - Boil water.
  - While water heats up, peel and slice the ginger into 1/8-inch thick pieces. Push down on the pieces with your knife to soften the ginger. Place into cheesecloth/hop bag.
  - When water hits boil, stir in sugar, then add ginger. Swirl the bag to help steep the ginger.
  - Boil for 30 minutes.
  - Cool, add to jug (ideally a jug with an airlock but in a pinch you can use a balloon with a tiny hole in it as a cap), add acid blend and yeast nutrient, pitch yeast.
  - Wait for fermentation to end (should take about 3-4 days).
  - Pour ginger beer from the jug into swing top bottles (like you would use for kombucha) with a funnel.
  - Midway through pouring the ginger beer into the bottles, add 2 oz of simple sugar (pre-dissolved sugar basically) or honey into each bottle.
  - Store in refrigerator for up to a week (maybe longer? I have no clue).
  - Let the ginger beer settle for a few hours before drinking especially for bottles with a lot of sediment.

NB: DO NOT SHAKE THE BOTTLES, the yeast/sediment produced by the fermentation process tastes nasty.

Note to self: I need to figure out how to transfer the ginger beer from the jug to the bottles in a way that reduces the amount of carbonation I'm losing by doing that.
