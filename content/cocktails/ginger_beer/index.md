sub_ingredient: true
blurb:
ingredients:
  - 2L water
  - 1/2 pound fresh ginger, grated
  - 1 oz fresh lime juice
  - 2 oz light brown sugar
steps:
  - Heat 1 cup of the water and pour into a food processor with the ginger.
  - Process until almost mulch-like.
  - Add this to the rest of the water in a large pan and bring it to a boil. Cover, remove from the heat, and allow it to stand for 1 hour.
  - Strain through a fine-mesh strainer (use a spoon to firmly press down on the ginger to extract all the flavor) and discard the pulp, add the lime juice and light brown sugar to the flavored water, stir well to dissolve, and allow the ginger mixture to come to room temperature before serving.
  - To store, transfer to pint or quart glass jars, cover, and keep in the refrigerator for up to a week.
