summary: My homebrewed ginger beer recipe. It's really good.
ingredients:
  - 1 gallon water
  - 3 thumb-sized pieces organic ginger
  - 2 cups sugar (preferably brown)
  - 1/2 tbsp citric acid (or wine maker's acid blend or lime or lemon juice)
  - 1 tsp yeast nutrient (optional but recommended)
  - 1/8 tsp yeast
  - 1/3 of a cup of authentic maple syrup
steps:
  - Start boiling water.
  - While water heats up, peel and slice the ginger into 1/8-inch thick pieces.
    Push down on the pieces with your knife to soften the ginger. Place into a
    cheesecloth/hop bag.
  - When water starts boiling, stir in sugar, then add ginger. Swirl the bag to
    help steep the ginger.
  - Let simmer for 30 minutes.
  - Cool for about 90 minutes
  - Add cooled ginger water to jug (ideally a jug with an airlock but in a pinch
    you can use a balloon with a tiny hole in it as a cap), add acid
    blend,  yeast nutrient and yeast.
  - Let jug sit at room temperature for about 2-3 days (if you're not sure, try
    3) (you don't want the fermentation to finish completely).
  - Mix a sample of the ginger beer and 4 tablespoons of authentic maple syrup
    in a small bowl, then pour it equally into about 4 1L swing top bottles
    (like you would use for kombucha) with a funnel.
  - Pour the ginger beer from the jug into swing top bottles with a funnel.
    Don't shake!
  - Let the ginger beer sit for about 4 hours, "burping" the bottles every so
    often if needed, to allow the fermentation to continue a little.
  - Store in refrigerator for up to a week (maybe longer? I have no clue). This
    will slow down the fermentation process which is what we want!
  - Drink up! Ginger beer brewed like this is as alcoholic as bread (so not
    very). Enjoy!

Note to self: I need to figure out how to transfer the ginger beer from the jug
to the bottles in a way that reduces the amount of carbonation I'm losing by
doing that.
