blurb:
ingredients:
  - 1 gallon water
  - 1 thumb-sized piece organic ginger
  - 2 cups sugar (light or dark)
  - 1/2 tbsp citric acid (or wine maker's acid blend or lime or lemon juice)
  - 1 tsp yeast nutrient
  - "? yeast (1/4 tsp?)"
steps:
  - Boil water.
  - While water heats up, peel and slice the ginger into 1/8-inch thick pieces. Place into cheesecloth/hop bag.
  - When water hits boil, stir in sugar, then add ginger. Swirl the bag to help steep the ginger.
  - Boil for 15 minutes, then pull a sample, quickly cool it, and taste. If the flavor isn’t strong enough for you, boil another five minutes and check again. Repeat until the spice level is right for you. BUT keep in mind the sugar will ferment, so it’s best to be a bit under the intensity you desire.
  - Cool, add to fermenter, add acid blend and yeast nutrient, pitch yeast.
