# Foundry Tips

- Use Google Earth Pro images for battle maps!
  - Save Google Earth images at the highest possible resolution 8192x4518 then change the grid size to a value between 20-30 so that 100m on the image is equal to 50in on the VTT (I'm not sure why the right value changes here....)
  - do keyword search for abandoned factory, building, etc. to get dilapidated/ruined buildings appropriate for the rifts setting

# Gming things to remember

- NPCs should communicate during combat whether to taunt, compromise or surrender
  - PCs should usually be able to communicate with most NPCs they encounter at a distance.
  - eg: Coalition captains should talk over short range comms. Demons should shout. Mages should mindspeak.
  - On a main NPC's turn they should always say something.
- Always talk to PCs directly --- instead of saying "John, what does Evicerator Jones do?", say "Evicerator Jones what do **you** do?"
  - "What do you do?" should be something I say often when trying to bring players into the action/roleplay and help everyone at the table both set the scene and have their PCs be included in the events going on
- Make PC choices matter --- focus on bringing to life the parts of the setting that the players are interacting with most and seem to be the most curious about.
  - This can and should start at character creation time / session 0 --- if a player creates a character who's on the run from a group of cultists who want to sacrifice him for being a heretic -> work on that faction, build it out, create some NPC sheets for it and figure out interesting ways of bringing them into play.
  - If PCs really like a particular NPC, be open to turning them into a recurring ally, maybe a Diana-esque handler or an NPC that joins their party. Have the NPC in-character offer this as an option they'd be into.
- Be flexible --- try to "yes, and" everything, if you can't say yes adjucate a compromise, write it down for future reference then continue play.

# One Pager Draft

**The campaignâ€™s premise and flavor**

HOOK

PREMISE

QUESTION?

**What separates this campaign from others?**

- Everything and the kitchen sink design turned up to 11, mowing down demons with mech suits, ..., the setting and system allows for you to create any character you want to and have it "work" with every other character that players want to play and the system supports it. 
- A open-ended setting that can support the wacky kind of roleplaying that I enjoy.
- A more mechanically dense and crunchier system with strong Foundry VTT support to allow for a hassle-free experience for both players and GM. I expect balancing combat encounters to be a challenge, more or less depending on what kinds of characters you want to play, but one that I'm up to.
- High lethality?

**What are the main things about this campaign that the characters would know going in?**

- The [basic premise of the Savage Rifts setting](https://peginc.com/product/rifts-welcome-to-the-post-apocalypse-pdf/) --- basically a post-post-apocalypse kicked off by the cataclysmic return of magic on Earth and the opening of inter-dimensional portals all over it --- creating a pressure cooker environment with cyborgs, demons, aliens from outer and inner space, fascists, anything you can think of rubbing up against one another.
- ...

**What characters work best in the campaign?**

We'll be using the Savage Worlds ruleset for this campaign, with any character classes/edges/skills/etc. from the Savage Rifts expansion/sourcebooks books being fair-game.

I want to support absolutely any kind of wacky character in this campaign. This ranges from a human living in the post-post-apocalypse trying their best to survive, a previously hive mind-ed alien who finds themselves separated from the hive after falling into a portal to Earth, a spirit bonded to a suit of armor, ...   

**What potentially troubling themes might this campaign include?**

Everything mentioned below is up for discussion/removal if anyone isn't comfortable:

- Deadly combat against sapient beings of all kinds is to be expected.
- Fascism. Players should expect to fight against a **lot** of fascist factions.
- Good and evil are **not** black and white. Yes, most people can agree that the actions of the higher ups in a fascist nation-state are "evil" but the actions conscripted grunts are forced to take aren't so clear. PCs should think what killing means for each of them:
  - Is killing enemy soldiers a necessary evil for the greater good? Is life so cheap that killing doesn't really matter? Does death simply quicken the newly dead's journey to a higher plane of existence? You decide!
- 

**What group patrons might the players select as a group? Who might serve as their primary quest giver?**

First Chief Elle of Owls, Head of Morale and Discipline for the Tomorrow Legion will be the one to send the Spec. Ops. Div. Gamma 9er on their first mission. But they'll be expected to help out around the Tomorrow Legion's base of operations Castle Refuge in any way they can.

# Map

![](/img/tabletop/rifts/castle_refuge_map.jpg)

- Throw a few different ideas / factions into the mix --- allowing players to choose which part of the bigger picture to unravel first (is everything connected?)
- [See arcs below](#arc---ideas)... We can set them up here.

# Bangs


- Play begins in media-res --- a first mission gone wrong, a trial by fire.
- PCs come under fire in an abandoned during a routine exploratory mission from a Coalition special ops unit and a troop of Federation of Magic mages
  - Each PC starts in a position appropriate for them as the self-destruction procedures start crumbling the foundations of the facility they're in:
    - A smart PC is in front of a console contemplating what to do with the doppleganger tech they've just stumbled upon.
    - A leader PC is overseeing the surrounding area --- watching the Coalition special ops unit and the troop of Federation of Magic mages quickly approaching the PCs location.
    - A brawny PC is fighting the mute doppleganger of another PC.
    - The last PC is trying to convince the brawny PC that they're the real one and not a doppleganger. But everything that they can do, the doppleganger can too --- making this a spicey meatball indeed. 

#
- We've got one living but quickly dying doppleganger of a PC (the result of a dangerous cloning technology that the PCs found on a routine exploratory mission they were sent on) of the PCs with the rest dead. We've got killer robots going on a rampage. We've got demons chasing after non-demons (telepathic? they can express their non-evil-ness). All sides are fighting all other sides and the PCs are stuck in the middle of it all.
- The PCs are hunkered down in a bunker of some kind fending off attackers on all sides. Objective: Survive / Escape
  - Repair a vehicle and roll out? Fend off the attack? Hide and hope for the best? Ally with one side against the others?

# Castle Refuge Intro

 Hello! I've run a few games centered around Castle Refuge now - here's what I tend to focus on: (TL,DR - Think Rebel Alliance (Star Wars) at Yavin IV, led and run by the MCU Avengers (with all their big personalities), in a world that is part Port Protection and part The Walking Dead, with Nazis to your North and South, and Sauron to your East.)

Castle Refuge is new: Yes, there are power players and experienced NPCs involved to guide the way and shepherd the forces, but every time the players come back to base, something has changed. Someone's office has moved, someone has a new setup, the East Wing has been repaired, no leaky roof!, the War Room is on-line, comms for the North East sector went down due to a ley line storm, and a SET has been dispatched to effect a repair, the E Company, 2nd Battalion Legionnaires has a new commander, they're always out on a formation run. etc. There is the overwhelming feeling of hey, we're really doing something good here, but it is tempered with Dammit! We don't have enough [teams, resources, equipment, territory, power, etc.] to do that now :( - So, optimism vs. scarcity.

The Tomorrow Legion is a bustle of varied activity: The TL's primary mission these days is to take in all of these refugees from the MN territories, get them settled, give them hope, and put them to work rebuilding. As such, many hopeful types are attracted to the cause as word gets out. These hopeful types come from all walks of life - hi-tech mercs, mystical beings, powerful psis and magic users. The Legion is pioneering multi-disciplinary tactics. Teams are in and out. NPCs that your team came across last session may be out on a long-range mission now. A SET had a successful rescue mission, and now a group of about 100 refugees are lined up to receive basic necessities and medical care. The 1st Battalion Legionnaires commandeered the Vehicle Bay today to conduct a mission brief to secure the western flank from encroaching Brodkil. - So, an ever changing landscape of different faces and vehicles, all moving towards or recovering from a specific activity.

The Legion is textbook rag-tag group of heroes: Some started out full of piss and vinegar to change the world dammit! Some joined after a disreputable life to make some good. Still others are hanging around for a time, biding time for the next gig. People come with their own hopes, dreams, and problems. With the Legion being such a small organization, it is going to be dominated by big personalities. Some will be likable, some a bit too much, some not enough. But all who've signed on likely believe they're doing the right thing. What happens when disagreements occur? - So, take a random slice of The Tomorrow Legion Player's Guide, and those are the weirdo heroes who're hanging around the castle.

Geography matters: Don't forget that the town of Refuge is growing around the Castle. Then branch out further - new roads (physical and relational) are being built with the surrounding communities! These communities have their own perks, problems, and people. Balance this growth with The threats of CS Missouri and CS El Dorado to the north and south respectively (Both New Chillicothe and Fort El Dorado are about 250 mi away). The True Federation is a comfortable 500ish mi to the East, but they are just as scary.

EDIT: I want to add - In general, the Legionnaires do not the Tomorrow Legion make. Officers, NCOs, and Soldiers of the TL have the fourfold missions of Command and Control, Area Security, Mission Support, and Mission Sustainment. Without these pieces, the real heroes of the Legion (SETs, the players) could not do their job. That said, the heavy lifting and in-roads to success are accomplished by small teams of highly capable and specialized individuals. Some are less than savory, but dammit if they don't get results. Most SETs will get briefed by Top Chief Elle of Owls (or her Warrant Officer intermediaries). They'll see rank and file along the way, and will rub shoulders with them on bigger missions (because Logistics will be handled by them) or if they are close to the castle (training or conducting security ops) - but the teams are out on their own for the most part.

# Setting changes

## Coalition

Turn Coalition into a white Christian fundementalist group

SAMAS -> SAMARITAN suits with a crucifixion vibe

White cruxifixes instead of skull heads on armor

Regional American accents skew southern

Taking over regions leads to the subjugation of the local populace forcing them to convert


# Arc - Ideas

These arcs ideas should ideally mesh into one another gracefully rather than fully start and fully stop

- Evil Robots trying to colonize Earth arc (Terminator/Arnold voices, beep boops)
  - Investigate scene of an attack near Castle Refuge (lost a patrol, people the PCs knew)
  - Fend off attacks (siege of Castle Refuge)
  - Find the source of the bots --- some kind of factory world in a rift and blow it up MGS style.
- Evil Castle Refuge arc (evil dopplegangers) --- this would be a good arc later on once Castle Refuge has been established
  - Evil Castle Refuge's actions cause repercussions against normal Castle Refuge (reduced trust)
  - Encounter evil dopplegangers in the wild
  - Find Evil Castle Refuge on the map
  - Communicate with the source of this magic (Star Trek alien style) and choose how to deal with it.
- Demonic Refugee Crisis arc
  - Going into a hell-like rift to save good beings trapped there living under demonic rule
- Mad Max arc
  - PCs stranded on Mad Max-like world and must acquire means of returning back to Castle Refuge.
  - PCs might work for a warlord, rising through the ranks until they can find a way back home.
  - Racing! Vehicle-based transport missions
