# Map

![](/img/tabletop/rifts/castle_refuge_map.jpg)

# Intro


- Begin first mission in-media-res --- a first mission gone wrong.
- Throw a few different ideas / factions into the mix --- allowing players to choose which part of the bigger picture to unravel first (is everything connected?)
- [See arcs below](#arc---ideas)... We can set them up here.
- We've got one living doppleganger of the PCs with the rest dead. We've got killer robots going on a rampage. We've got demons chasing after non-demons (telepathic? they can express their non-evil-ness). All sides are fighting all other sides and the PCs are stuck in the middle of it all.
- The PCs are hunkered down in a bunker of some kind fending off attackers on all sides. Objective: Survive / Escape
  - Repair a vehicle and roll out? Fend off the attack? Hide and hope for the best? Ally with one side against the others?

# Castle Refuge Intro

 Hello! I've run a few games centered around Castle Refuge now - here's what I tend to focus on: (TL,DR - Think Rebel Alliance (Star Wars) at Yavin IV, led and run by the MCU Avengers (with all their big personalities), in a world that is part Port Protection and part The Walking Dead, with Nazis to your North and South, and Sauron to your East.)

Castle Refuge is new: Yes, there are power players and experienced NPCs involved to guide the way and shepherd the forces, but every time the players come back to base, something has changed. Someone's office has moved, someone has a new setup, the East Wing has been repaired, no leaky roof!, the War Room is on-line, comms for the North East sector went down due to a ley line storm, and a SET has been dispatched to effect a repair, the E Company, 2nd Battalion Legionnaires has a new commander, they're always out on a formation run. etc. There is the overwhelming feeling of hey, we're really doing something good here, but it is tempered with Dammit! We don't have enough [teams, resources, equipment, territory, power, etc.] to do that now :( - So, optimism vs. scarcity.

The Tomorrow Legion is a bustle of varied activity: The TL's primary mission these days is to take in all of these refugees from the MN territories, get them settled, give them hope, and put them to work rebuilding. As such, many hopeful types are attracted to the cause as word gets out. These hopeful types come from all walks of life - hi-tech mercs, mystical beings, powerful psis and magic users. The Legion is pioneering multi-disciplinary tactics. Teams are in and out. NPCs that your team came across last session may be out on a long-range mission now. A SET had a successful rescue mission, and now a group of about 100 refugees are lined up to receive basic necessities and medical care. The 1st Battalion Legionnaires commandeered the Vehicle Bay today to conduct a mission brief to secure the western flank from encroaching Brodkil. - So, an ever changing landscape of different faces and vehicles, all moving towards or recovering from a specific activity.

The Legion is textbook rag-tag group of heroes: Some started out full of piss and vinegar to change the world dammit! Some joined after a disreputable life to make some good. Still others are hanging around for a time, biding time for the next gig. People come with their own hopes, dreams, and problems. With the Legion being such a small organization, it is going to be dominated by big personalities. Some will be likable, some a bit too much, some not enough. But all who've signed on likely believe they're doing the right thing. What happens when disagreements occur? - So, take a random slice of The Tomorrow Legion Player's Guide, and those are the weirdo heroes who're hanging around the castle.

Geography matters: Don't forget that the town of Refuge is growing around the Castle. Then branch out further - new roads (physical and relational) are being built with the surrounding communities! These communities have their own perks, problems, and people. Balance this growth with The threats of CS Missouri and CS El Dorado to the north and south respectively (Both New Chillicothe and Fort El Dorado are about 250 mi away). The True Federation is a comfortable 500ish mi to the East, but they are just as scary.

EDIT: I want to add - In general, the Legionnaires do not the Tomorrow Legion make. Officers, NCOs, and Soldiers of the TL have the fourfold missions of Command and Control, Area Security, Mission Support, and Mission Sustainment. Without these pieces, the real heroes of the Legion (SETs, the players) could not do their job. That said, the heavy lifting and in-roads to success are accomplished by small teams of highly capable and specialized individuals. Some are less than savory, but dammit if they don't get results. Most SETs will get briefed by Top Chief Elle of Owls (or her Warrant Officer intermediaries). They'll see rank and file along the way, and will rub shoulders with them on bigger missions (because Logistics will be handled by them) or if they are close to the castle (training or conducting security ops) - but the teams are out on their own for the most part.


# Arc - Ideas

These arcs ideas should ideally mesh into one another gracefully rather than fully start and fully stop

- Evil Robots trying to colonize Earth arc (Terminator/Arnold voices, beep boops)
  - Investigate scene of an attack near Castle Refuge (lost a patrol, people the PCs knew)
  - Fend off attacks (siege of Castle Refuge)
  - Find the source of the bots --- some kind of factory world in a rift and blow it up MGS style.
- Evil Castle Refuge arc (evil dopplegangers) --- this would be a good arc later on once Castle Refuge has been established
  - Evil Castle Refuge's actions cause repercussions against normal Castle Refuge (reduced trust)
  - Encounter evil dopplegangers in the wild
  - Find Evil Castle Refuge on the map
  - Communicate with the source of this magic (Star Trek alien style) and choose how to deal with it.
- Demonic Refugee Crisis arc
  - Going into a hell-like rift to save good beings trapped there living under demonic rule
- Mad Max arc
  - PCs stranded on Mad Max-like world and must acquire means of returning back to Castle Refuge.
  - PCs might work for a warlord, rising through the ranks until they can find a way back home.
  - Racing! Vehicle-based transport missions

# One Pager Draft

**The campaignâ€™s premise and flavor**

HOOK

PREMISE

QUESTION?

**What separates this campaign from others?**

- Everything and the kitchen sink design turned up to 11, mowing down demons with mech suits, ..., the setting and system allows for you to create any character you want to and have it "work" with every other character that players want to play and the system supports it. 
- A open-ended setting that can support the wacky kind of roleplaying that I enjoy.
- A more mechanically dense and crunchier system with strong Foundry VTT support to allow for a hassle-free experience for both players and GM. I expect balancing combat encounters to be a challenge, more or less depending on what kinds of characters you want to play, but one that I'm up to.
- High lethality?

**What are the main things about this campaign that the characters would know going in?**

- The [basic premise of the Savage Rifts setting](https://peginc.com/product/rifts-welcome-to-the-post-apocalypse-pdf/) --- basically a post-post-apocalypse kicked off by the cataclysmic return of magic on Earth and the opening of inter-dimensional portals all over it --- creating a pressure cooker environment with cyborgs, demons, aliens from outer and inner space, fascists, anything you can think of rubbing up against one another.
- ...

**What characters work best in the campaign?**

We'll be using the Savage Worlds ruleset for this campaign, with any character classes/edges/skills/etc. from the Savage Rifts expansion/sourcebooks books being fair-game.

I want to support absolutely any kind of wacky character in this campaign. This ranges from a human living in the post-post-apocalypse trying their best to survive, a previously hive mind-ed alien who finds themselves separated from the hive after falling into a portal to Earth, a spirit bonded to a suit of armor, ...   

**What potentially troubling themes might this campaign include?**

I'm not expecting to get into anything too challenging thematically in this campaign. Although, I'm expecting to separate the campaign into several shorter and thematically-cohesive arcs. If this changes, we'll talk about it.

This setting assumes that not everyone can be reasoned with. True inherent evil does exist, good does too and PCs will fall somewhere in the middle (probably).

**What group patrons might the players select as a group? Who might serve as their primary quest giver?**

- The player characters will be new recruits of the Tomorrow Legion, doing field work in and around Castle Refuge. HOOK?
