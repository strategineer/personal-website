# Intro


- Begin first mission in-media-res --- a first mission gone wrong.
- Throw a few different ideas / factions into the mix --- allowing players to choose which part of the bigger picture to unravel first (is everything connected?)
- [See arcs below](#arc---ideas)... We can set them up here.
- We've got one living doppleganger of the PCs with the rest dead. We've got killer robots going on a rampage. We've got demons chasing after non-demons (telepathic? they can express their non-evil-ness). All sides are fighting all other sides and the PCs are stuck in the middle of it all.
- The PCs are hunkered down in a bunker of some kind fending off attackers on all sides. Objective: Survive / Escape
  - Repair a vehicle and roll out? Fend off the attack? Hide and hope for the best? Ally with one side against the others?

# Arc - Ideas

These arcs ideas should ideally mesh into one another gracefully rather than fully start and fully stop

- Evil Robots trying to colonize Earth arc (Terminator/Arnold voices, beep boops)
  - Investigate scene of an attack near Castle Refuge (lost a patrol, people the PCs knew)
  - Fend off attacks (siege of Castle Refuge)
  - Find the source of the bots --- some kind of factory world in a rift and blow it up MGS style.
- Evil Castle Refuge arc (evil dopplegangers) --- this would be a good arc later on once Castle Refuge has been established
  - Evil Castle Refuge's actions cause repercussions against normal Castle Refuge (reduced trust)
  - Encounter evil dopplegangers in the wild
  - Find Evil Castle Refuge on the map
  - Communicate with the source of this magic (Star Trek alien style) and choose how to deal with it.
- Demonic Refugee Crisis arc
  - Going into a hell-like rift to save good beings trapped there living under demonic rule
- Mad Max arc
  - PCs stranded on Mad Max-like world and must acquire means of returning back to Castle Refuge.
  - PCs might work for a warlord, rising through the ranks until they can find a way back home.
  - Racing! Vehicle-based transport missions

# One Pager Draft

**The campaignâ€™s premise and flavor**

HOOK

PREMISE

QUESTION?

**What separates this campaign from others?**

- Everything and the kitchen sink design turned up to 11, mowing down demons with mech suits, ..., the setting and system allows for you to create any character you want to and have it "work" with every other character that players want to play and the system supports it. 
- A open-ended setting that can support the wacky kind of roleplaying that I enjoy.
- A more mechanically dense and crunchier system with strong Foundry VTT support to allow for a hassle-free experience for both players and GM. I expect balancing combat encounters to be a challenge, more or less depending on what kinds of characters you want to play, but one that I'm up to.
- High lethality?

**What are the main things about this campaign that the characters would know going in?**

- The [basic premise of the Savage Rifts setting](https://peginc.com/product/rifts-welcome-to-the-post-apocalypse-pdf/) --- basically a post-post-apocalypse kicked off by the cataclysmic return of magic on Earth and the opening of inter-dimensional portals all over it --- creating a pressure cooker environment with cyborgs, demons, aliens from outer and inner space, fascists, anything you can think of rubbing up against one another.
- ...

**What characters work best in the campaign?**

We'll be using the Savage Worlds ruleset for this campaign, with any character classes/edges/skills/etc. from the Savage Rifts expansion/sourcebooks books being fair-game.

I want to support absolutely any kind of wacky character in this campaign. This ranges from a human living in the post-post-apocalypse trying their best to survive, a previously hive mind-ed alien who finds themselves separated from the hive after falling into a portal to Earth, a spirit bonded to a suit of armor, ...   

**What potentially troubling themes might this campaign include?**

I'm not expecting to get into anything too challenging thematically in this campaign. Although, I'm expecting to separate the campaign into several shorter and thematically-cohesive arcs. If this changes, we'll talk about it.

This setting assumes that not everyone can be reasoned with. True inherent evil does exist, good does too and PCs will fall somewhere in the middle (probably).

**What group patrons might the players select as a group? Who might serve as their primary quest giver?**

- The player characters will be new recruits of the Tomorrow Legion, doing field work in and around Castle Refuge. HOOK?
