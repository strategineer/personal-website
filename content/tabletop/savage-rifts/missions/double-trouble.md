- Play begins in media-res --- a first mission gone wrong, a trial by fire.
- PCs begin in a high tech laboratory hidden inside an abandoned looking pre-Cataclysm factory on a routine exploratory mission
- PCs notice both a Coalition special ops unit and a troop of Federation of Magic mages coming in their direction as they scramble to deal with the situation and get out safely
  - Each PC starts in a position appropriate for them as the self-destruction procedures start crumbling the foundations of the facility they're in:
    - A smart PC is in front of a console contemplating what to do with the doppleganger tech they've just stumbled upon.
    - A leader PC is overseeing the surrounding area --- watching the Coalition special ops unit and the troop of Federation of Magic mages quickly approaching the PCs location.
    - A brawny PC is fighting the mute doppleganger of another PC.
    - The last PC is trying to convince the brawny PC that they're the real one and not a doppleganger. But everything that they can do, the doppleganger can too --- making this a spicey meatball indeed. 


- We've got one living but quickly dying doppleganger of a PC (the result of a dangerous cloning technology that the PCs found on a routine exploratory mission they were sent on) of the PCs with the rest dead. We've got killer robots going on a rampage. We've got demons chasing after non-demons (telepathic? they can express their non-evil-ness). All sides are fighting all other sides and the PCs are stuck in the middle of it all.
- The PCs are hunkered down in a bunker of some kind fending off attackers on all sides. Objective: Survive / Escape
  - Repair a vehicle and roll out? Fend off the attack? Hide and hope for the best? Ally with one side against the others?
