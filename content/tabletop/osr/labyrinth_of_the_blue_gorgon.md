Lanmino, an elf with all the connections, Freeya the Magnificent, a novice painter and apprentice mage extraordinaire, Blotbug, a goblin witch on the run from the death cult who tried to sacrifice him to their dark god, Marlon, a thief and expert con artist, form a thieving crew unlike any other.

Due to their recent exploits, the Crew found themselves taking on their biggest job yet. Breaking into a vault and stealing a painting, the Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon (painted by Freeya the Magnificent many years ago, or so he claims). They were asked by the wizard who gave them this job to hang the painting in their safehouse at night after stealing it and waiting for the moonlight to shine onto it. Desperate for money, they accepted the odd request.

As the moonlight shined onto the painting, all members of the Crew were pulled into it through some kind of magic. Once inside the Labyrinth, the Crew freed the Ashen Chanterelle, a slave to the Blue Gorgon tasked with guarding the labyrinth. She opened the door leading to the rest of the labyrinth for them.

They met with Lady Crucem Capilli, a winged and horned collector of curios, artifacts and art. She tasked the Crew with bringing her interesting items from elsewhere in the labyrinth and Freeya with painting a scene from the labyrinth.

After much deliberation and frantic movement, the group chose to head west toward the "Gardens". 

Marlon entered the first room to the west with a 10ft pole in hand testing for traps followed by Freeya. Soon after, Freeya found himself badly hurt and at the bottom of a 10ft pit created by the room's moving light casting a shadow from Marlon's body.

Marlon's attempt to pull Freeya up using his 10ft pole failed, just as critically as Freeya's attempt to not fall in the pit in the first place, leading to Freeya remaining in the pit, now with Marlon's pole for company.

At this point, a dwarf burst through the western door of the room running for his life, half-clothed, bruised and bleeding. A rushing of footsteps was heard coming from behind him.

**The campaignâ€™s premise and flavor**

You play as members of a newly formed group of outlaws, committing small acts of theft, extortion and fraud. You might be a group like Robin Hood and his Merry Men, or be more self-serving or just plain evil. A powerful mage asks you to steal a painting from a well guarded private collection. You accept and the job goes perfectly.

For some reason, he's requested that you hold on to the painting for a while and that you to hang it up in the abandoned warehouse you've been using as a safehouse. As the moonlight shines through the broken windows, the scene depicted in the painting comes alive and beckons you to enter it. You venture into the unknown world in the painting, and quickly become obsessed with exploring it, each of you for reasons only you understand.

Will you find what you've always been looking for in *The Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon*?

**What separates this campaign from others?**

- A focus on old school dungeon crawling. Think resource management, using your wits more often than your character abilities, encountering more rational NPCs/factions that you can interact with peacefully (usually) and less mindless monsters to slay.
- An otherworldy setting with less fantasy tropes and more mythical high concept weird shit.
- It's going to get weird and you're going to like it (I hope).

**What are the main things about this campaign that the characters would know going in?**

- The pay for the job seemed a little too good to be true.
- Paintings that "pull" you into them aren't normal, this is some magical shit.
- Life is short and brutal. You're lucky to have survived this long.
- *The Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon* is compelling you to explore it and you'll discover its secrets or die trying.

**What characters work best in the campaign?**

We'll be using the Shadowdark RPG rules and classes. You can imagine that a group of Robin Hood-esque outlaws might have a fighter (some muscle), a thief (some stealth), a priest (some support), a wizard (some magic). But anything goes, play what you want and how you want!

**What potentially troubling themes might this campaign include?**

The following list is not exhaustive but gives you a good idea: gore, depression, madness, death, suicide, unrequited love, creepy nightmare plants, invasive body horror, abusive relationships, parasitic seduction, gross undead babies.

**What group patrons might the players select as a group? Who might serve as their primary quest giver?**

The group will quickly find NPCs in the labyrinth who are willing to give them rewards in exchange for their services.
