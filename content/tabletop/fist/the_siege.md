[MISSION SUMMARY]

An avant-garde movie production company is looking to shoot the most realistic action movie of all time, think The Raid.

They've found a decrepit small town police station to use as the stage and they want FIST operatives to act and fight in a sequence of scenes finishing the movie off with the climatic siege of the police station by some evil force (zombies).

**Tactics**

- How to approach the mission? In-media res? Recon from the outskirts? Paradrop?

**Espionage**

- Describe each relevant NPC with clear motivations, assets and liabilities that PCs can interact with and infosec challenges to overcome. 

**Action**

- Describe catalyzing elements for actions: enemy patrols, boss encounters, special modifiers that change combat in an interesting way (a network of neural implants that lock down the entire facility if a soldier is harmed)
