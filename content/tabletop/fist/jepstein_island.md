BOOTY have taken over the private island of financier-cum-pedo Effrey Jepstein and is looking to sacrifice the people on the island to appease their (old) god, Hnarqu.

<!--more-->

ANVIL operatives, Moneybag Jones and Misses Beast (Mansion, exterior), have been paid by Weinstein to extract him from the Island.  

Objective: 
- Disrupt the BOOTY ritual.
- [OPTIONAL] Recover Jepstein's collection of CYCLOPS gadgets.
- [OPTIONAL] Extract Jordan Cane (Lighthouse), the retired FBI agent turned actor.
- [OPTIONAL] Sabotage ANVIL operatives's attempt to extract Effrey Jepstein.
- [OPTIONAL] Extract Prince Andrew (Yacht) and destroy any incriminating physical evidence (video footage).

Reward:
- All recovered CYCLOPS gadgets.

Consequence:
- If the BOOTY ritual is disrupted, BOOTY's old god becomes more restless and shifts more of its focus to our time. Otherwise, the island will be submerged into the sea.
- If Jepstein is killed, Big Hollywood will go after those responsible.
- If Prince Andrew is killed, the succession of the crown of the British Empire will be in flux leading to a splintering of the empire and warring factions.

NPCs:
- Effrey Jepstein "Effrey Jepstein is my name, Money and sex trafficking is my game.", financier
- Jordan Cane "If looks can kill I'd be a holocaust", retired FBI agent turned playboy/actor
- Johnny "Ohhhhh no", security guard, always almost peeing/shitting his pants, has super IBS.
- Armand "My friends, welcome!", freelance arms dealer serving any and all PMCs with weapons/armor delivered anywhere anytime.
- Fishhook "Drown and be saved", BOOTY leader, a human-shark hybrid with two hooks for hands and a oversized tricorn hat.
- Kenton "I'm not going to jail for this", Jepstein's head of security.
- Prince Andrew "I don't sweat so that can't be true", Prince of the British Empire, parties hard and is NOT a family man no matter what he says.

1. Yacht: 1x CYCLOPS gadget. Fire Island-esque partiers partying, oblivious to the rest of the island being taken over by pirates. Prince Andrew of the British Empire sticks out like a sore thumb, partying with the rest.
2. Village: Homes for the help, the trafficked and the partiers. Pirates are keeping everyone inside awaiting to be sacrificed in the ritual. 
3. Forest Dock: Armand, Arms dealer, docked, ready to trade or give weapons/armor on loan.
4. Forest: Pirate drowned god ritual being prepped here. Pirates are leading island inhabitants from the Village [2] to the ritual totem at [4]. 
5. Port: Pirates's boat docked with a light guard complement. HIND combat helicopter parked nearby, Hello pilot wandering around the port waiting for instructions from Fishhook. 
6. Mansion: 1x CYCLOPS gadget. Red alert engaged, Jepstein's with a handful of his guards are on lockdown, waiting for help to arrive.
7. Lagoon: Contains a secret entrance to the Mansion [6] and the Yacht [1]. 
8. Lighthouse: Prime sniping position. Kenton and Jordan Cane holed up here waiting for the right moment to secure the island and extract, respectively.
9. Security Room: Dead guards litter the floor, sliced and stabbed by a katana. Johnny, intern guard, tumbles out of an empty locker when FIST operatives arrive. Contains CCTV with cameras all across the island.  

**Tactics**

- FIST operatives can insert themselves onto the island by already being planted on the island when the Cult attack happens, parachuting in, stealth submarining...
- Security Room with island-wide CCTV coverage might be useful.
- Lighthouse has Kenton and Jordan and would provide good sniper recon position.
- HIND hello landed near the Port, hello pilot with keys must be nearby.

**Espionage**

- Armand, Arms Dealer, can provide FIST operatives with in-mission weapons/armor (p. 83) for the promise of a favor.  
- The British Empire's royal family would reward the retrieval of Prince Andrew ("I don't sweat") and the destruction of any incriminating evidence of his presence on the island.
- Jordan Cane can be convinced to help agents out in exchange for extraction.
- Jepstein's head of security can be collaborated with. He's expecting to collaborate with ANVIL operatives but is willing to work with FIST if their objectives align with his (rescuing Jepstein).
- ANVIL operatives can be taken out or parlayed with. 
- Asano Uzu, SHADO operative, will not communicate with FIST operatives and will attempt to escape if discovered tampering with the CCTV footage. 
- Effrey Jepstein will pay handsomely for his life.

**Action**

- BOOTY patrols (Forest, Village) and their leader Fishhook (Forest) conducting the ritual.
- ANVIL operatives (Mansion, exterior) trying to get inside Jepstein's locked down compound to extract him.
- Jepstein's Guards (Mansion, interior)
