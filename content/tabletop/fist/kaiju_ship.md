FIST has been tasked with freeing or destroying a kaiju named Caesar. It is currently in a U.S. Navy ship – the USS Sherlock. FIST must infiltrate the ship, and deal with the kaiju in any way they can.

At the same time, the Yellowjackets squad has been tasked by CYCLOPS to recover the crowns used by prof. Gotrovitch to manipulate the creature!

<!--more-->

LOCATION: USS. Sherlock, Atlantic Ocean.

SITUATION: Caesar is a dangerous biological weapon. It was discovered in the vicinity of Pompeii by Prof. Gotrovitch along with CYCLOPS. Gotrovitch betrayed them and sold his discovery to the American Navy, along with the professor’s services.

They are currently on route towards the U.S. West coast aboard the USS. Sherlock. CYCLOPS has sent an enemy squad to recover the kaiju.

INFILTRATION/EXFILTRATION: The client has given FIST a Zodiac rubber boat with a magnetic lock. You can board the ship wherever you like, and the ship will stay there until you exfiltrate.

Objectives:
- Prevent the navy – or any other faction – from acquiring Caesar.
- [OPTIONAL] Eliminate Prof. Gotrovitch.
- [OPTIONAL] Recover Caesar, dead or alive.
- [OPTIONAL] Recover the two crowns.

Rewards:
- At the end of the mission, if the main objective was accomplished, roll twice on the MISSION REWARDS table. Roll once for each side objective accomplished.
- Side objective listing “recover” as an objective means whatever is recovered is given to the client. If the players choose to keep the object of the mission, it is not considered accomplished.

Consequences:
- If Prof. Gotrovitch lives, he has a grudge against the FIST operatives for ruining his years worth of research and so will begin his vendetta against FIST by providing other organizations with his research to compete with FIST.
- If Caesar escapes while being friendly with FIST or if FIST extracts with both crowns, FIST operatives can call in a tactical Caesar drop in subsequent missions. 

NPCs:
- **CAPTAIN HERMAN** (6HP)
  - wants to keep his crew safe.
  - Heavy revolver (1D6+1 DAMAGE)
  - Bridge’s hatch control key
  - CAPTAIN: If the ship gets too damaged or starts to sink Herman will gain 1D6 temporary HP, and solely focus on rescuing his crew. Herman knows his crew and cannot be fooled by disguises.

- **PROF. IVAN GOTROVITCH** (3HP)
  - wants to survive to continue his research another day.
  - Psycho-armor prototype (3 ARMOR, as long as he is
conscious)
  - Crown of Control
  - Lab’s hatch control key
  - **ORDER**: Whoever is wearing the Crown of Control can force whoever is wearing the Crown of Subjugation (currently Caesar) to obey an order. Gotrovitch will use this to save himself if he feels threatened.

- **CAESAR** (24HP)
  - wants to escape from his prison and return to the sea.
  - Juvenile shell (3 ARMOR)
  - Crab-like claws (1D6+2 DAMAGE)
  - 8 legs
  - Crown of Subjugation (Prevents the wearer from using psy powers and forces them to obey the Crown of Control)
  - Telekinetic armor (3 additional ARMOR, only if the Crown of Subjugation is removed or damaged)
  - **VISION OF PAIN**: When hurt, Caesar sends visions to his attacker. If Caesar does this against an NPC, roll for CHOKE. For a player, roll 1D3 for vision content:

{{< rpg_table name=CaesarVision >}}
| Vision |
| --- |
| A CYCLOPS squad killing Caesar’s parents. |
| Prof. Gotrovitch’s experiments. |
| Resting in the depths of the Tyrrhenian Sea. |
{{< /rpg_table >}}

  - **PINCH (BOSS MOVE)**: When damaged in melee, Caesar grabs the attacker. If they fail a +FORCEFUL roll, they are stuck in the claw until CAESAR dies or takes 3 damage in one attack.
  - **FREEDOM (BOSS MOVE)**: If the crown of subjugation is damaged or removed, Caesar’s suppressed telekinetic capabilities will come out at once, cutting the ship in half. If the players did not harm him (or stopped harming him after the first VISION OF PAIN), he will help them escape. Otherwise, he returns to the sea.
- **(GUARDS) SAILORS** (3HP)
  - M16 rifle in bad condition (3 DAMAGE)
  - BOREDOM: Sailors will leave their post to investigate any commotion.
- **(GUARDS) OCTOBOTS** (3HP)
  - Chrome tentacles (1 ARMOR).
  - Electric shocks - stuns for 1 turn (1D3 DAMAGE).
  - HUGGER: Attempt to surround and disable targets with eletric shocks.
- **(SQUAD) THE YELLOWJACKETS** (3HP)
  - want to recover both crowns and exfiltrate with all their members alive and well.
  - Bulletproof vest (1 ARMOR)
  - MP5 submachine-gun (1D6 DAMAGE)
  - Good disposable silencer (3 uses)
  - **QUEEN**: Every squad member is lead by Queen, an advanced AI. It communicates with the squad through earpieces. The Yellowjackets are perfectly synchronized. As long as the Yellowjackets can communicate with Queen, two members of the squad act when the players fail a roll against them.
  - **ESCAPE (BOSS MOVE)**: Queen cares about its subordinates and will immediately call off the mission if any member is gravely injured. All available team members will start suppressing enemies with their submachine guns while dragging wounded friendlies to their extraction point.
  - **SQUAD**: There are 4 members in the squad. Blazkowicz is the team leader. Titiana is the technician. She created Queen and is a lockpicking expert. Bishop is the point man. He is always the first to burst through doors. Hasan is the medic. He is exceptionally good with knives, for surgery and CQC.
