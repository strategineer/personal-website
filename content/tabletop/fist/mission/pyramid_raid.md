After years of search, the tomb of Amushpet IV has been found by the R&D team at IRIS.

IRIS established a base of operations within the tomb and have been exploring the expansive tomb and digging up any artifacts they can find. But IRIS HQ lost contact with their research base and so they've contracted us to go to the tomb and find out what happened and if anything can be salvaged.

<!--more-->

Objectives:
- Investigate disruption of IRIS research base at Amushpet IV's tomb.
- Retrieve any surviving members of IRIS.
- [OPTIONAL] Salvage any research done by IRIS researchers.
- ...

Rewards:
- ...

Consequences:
- If any worshippers of Set escape, then the memetic influence of SET spreads throughout the world. Religious organisations in particular are prone to this influence and will over time change their beliefs  to focus on Set above all else.
