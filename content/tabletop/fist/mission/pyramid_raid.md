A week ago the R&D team at IRIS, you know the guys who are really into that ancient Egyptian shit, found the tomb of Amushpet IV which they've been looking for forever.

Soon after, IRIS established a base of operations outside entrance to the tomb and they've been exploring and cataloguing their finds since then (clay tablets, jewels, gold, you know *things you'd find in a tomb*).

Problem is... IRIS HQ lost contact with their people at the base this morning and so they've contracted us to go to the tomb and find out what happened and see if anything can be salvaged.

Whenever IRIS sets up an on-site base like this, they set up a barrier to prevent signals from coming into or out of the site. But on-site crew are expected to communicate back to HQ with their progress using the carefully monitored GPS phone, usually with a spare on-site, that can send and receive signals through the barrier.

Maybe their phone's broken and they misplaced the spare? Whatever the case may be, you'll need to get on-site and make contact with the head IRIS researcher, codenamed Brainiac, and figure out what's going over there.
