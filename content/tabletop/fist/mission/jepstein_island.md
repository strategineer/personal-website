Our client for this job has tipped us off that BOOTY, you know those pirates and elder god worshipping cultists?, are planning on taking over Effrey Jepstein's private island in the middle of the Caribbean during his next big party he's throwing and performing one of their rituals to appease their god. That's kind of their thing, we're not too worried about it.

Our client wants to us to send some agents, that's you, over to the island while the attack is happening using it as cover to, huh, let's just say, "acquire" some of the high tech gadgets that Jepstein has collected over the years and, conveniently for us, placed all over his island.

Jepstein's private island parties can get quite hectic, you never know who might be attending. You should expect the BOOTY pirates to up quite a fight and if you run into any members of Jepstein's Security force, you might be able to convince them that you're there to help (and get their help in return), just don't try to steal, cough, sorry "acquire" any gadgets while they're looking.

Objectives:
- Recover Jepstein's collection of CYCLOPS gadgets.
- [OPTIONAL] Disrupt the BOOTY ritual.
- [OPTIONAL] Extract Jordan Cane (Lighthouse), the retired FBI agent turned actor.
- [OPTIONAL] Sabotage ANVIL operatives's attempt to extract Effrey Jepstein.
- [OPTIONAL] Extract Prince Andrew (Yacht) by force and destroy any incriminating physical evidence (video footage).

Rewards:
- All recovered CYCLOPS gadgets.

Consequences:
- If the BOOTY ritual is disrupted, BOOTY's old god becomes more restless and shifts more of its focus to our time. Otherwise, the island will be submerged into the sea.
- If Jepstein is killed, Big Hollywood will go after those responsible.
- If Prince Andrew is killed, the succession of the crown of the British Empire will be in flux leading to a splintering of the empire and warring factions.

| Each CYCLOPS gadget is placed on a pedestal encased in a glass casing. Each one is trapped and the trap is activated if the glass is broken or removed without holding a button hidden on the pedestal. |

Otacon: We just just got this call from Jordan Cane, patching it through to you.

**Transmission by Jordan Cane (southern accent, drawl):**

Hi FIST? This is Jordan Cane, I'm sure you've heard of me from one of my many movies and my music [sounds of gunshots, explosions and Darude Sandstorm can be heard in the background].

I'm in a bit of the situation here [shu shu (cocks shotgun)] at Effrey Jepstein's private island and I'd pay you well to get over here and stop all this nonsense [pow pow (gunfire)] and get me out of here. Bye bye now.

Otacon: If you can find Jordan Cane and extract him from the island that would be great, I just love his music... (singing offtune) I remembeeeerr everyyyything (cough).

1. Yacht: Secret access to Tunnels [10]. 1x CYCLOPS gadget (floor trap doors, fall into water). Fire Island-esque partiers partying, oblivious to the rest of the island being taken over by pirates. Prince Andrew of the British Empire sticks out like a sore thumb, partying with the rest.
2. Village:  1x CYCLOPS gadget (sleep gas trap). Homes for the help, the trafficked and the partiers. Pirates are keeping everyone inside awaiting to be converted in to crab/fish people by the ritual. 
3. Forest Dock: 1x CYCLOPS gadget (net snare). Armand, Arms dealer, docked, ready to trade or give weapons/armor on loan.
4. Forest: Pirate drowned god ritual happening here. Pirates are leading island inhabitants from the Village [2] to the ritual totem at [4] and turning them into violent crab/fish people. 
5. Port: Pirates's boat docked with a light guard complement. HIND combat helicopter parked nearby, Hello pilot wandering around the port waiting for instructions from Fishhook. 
6. Mansion: Secret access to Tunnels [10]. 1x CYCLOPS gadget (electric floor). Red alert engaged, Jepstein's with a handful of his guards are on lockdown, waiting for help to arrive. Moneybag Jones and Anvilman (Mansion, exterior) are banging on the front door trying to get Jepstein to come out.
7. Lagoon: Secret access to Tunnels [10]. 
8. Lighthouse: Prime sniping position. Kenton and Jordan Cane holed up here waiting for the right moment to secure the island and extract, respectively.
9. Security Room: Dead guards litter the floor, sliced and stabbed by a katana. Johnny, intern guard, tumbles out of an empty locker when FIST operatives arrive. Contains CCTV with cameras all across the island.
10. Tunnels: Connects Lagoon [7] and Mansion [6] and the Yacht [1] through secret access doors. Roll on Monster or Robot tables (p. 104-105) for enemy encounters any time the tunnels are used for quick travel.

**Tactics**

- FIST operatives can insert themselves onto the island by already being planted on the island when the Cult attack happens, parachuting in, stealth submarining...
- Security Room with island-wide CCTV coverage might be useful.
- Lighthouse has Kenton and Jordan and would provide good sniper recon position.
- HIND hello landed near the Port, hello pilot with keys must be nearby.

**Espionage**

- Armand, Arms Dealer, can provide FIST operatives with in-mission weapons/armor (p. 83) for the promise of a favor.  
- The British Empire's royal family would reward the retrieval of Prince Andrew ("I don't sweat") and the destruction of any incriminating evidence of his presence on the island.
- Jordan Cane can be convinced to help agents out in exchange for extraction.
- Jepstein's head of security can be collaborated with. He's expecting to collaborate with ANVIL operatives but is willing to work with FIST if their objectives align with his (rescuing Jepstein).
- ANVIL operatives can be taken out or parlayed with. 
- Asano Uzu, SHADO operative, will not communicate with FIST operatives and will attempt to escape if discovered tampering with the CCTV footage. 
- Effrey Jepstein will pay handsomely for his life.

**Action**

- BOOTY patrols (Forest, Village) and their leader Fishhook (Forest) conducting the ritual.
- ANVIL operatives (Mansion, exterior) trying to get inside Jepstein's locked down compound to extract him.
- Jepstein's Guards (Mansion, interior)
