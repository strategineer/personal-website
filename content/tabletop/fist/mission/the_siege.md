Maps created by Tom Cartos https://www.tomcartos.com/police-station

An avant-garde movie production company is looking to shoot the most realistic action movie of all time and FIST operatives are being tasked with the job.

<!--more-->

They've found a decrepit small town police station to use as the stage and they want FIST operatives to direct, act and fight in a sequence of scenes finishing the movie off with the climatic siege of the police station by some evil force (zombies).

After a few scenes have been shot, during a break where the crew is conveniently separated from each other all throughout the police station (bathroom break, food break, prepping for the next scene), ANVIL forces ambush the crew, seemingly, to disrupt the filming of the movie.


Objectives:
- Direct and act in this movie (make it good! this is free advertisement for FIST).
- Protect the film crew.
- [OPTIONAL] Detain and recover anyone trying to disrupt the filming of the movie.
- ...

Rewards:
- 1x First Edition The Siege branded Weapon of choice per operative
- 1 Adoring Fan if the movie does well.

Consequences:
- If X happens, then Y...
- If ANVIL operatives fail to disrupt the shoot, then they self-fund a copycat movie themselves that FIST operatives can disrupt in revenge.
- If Cames Jameron survives, he will become an operative himself to learn how things really happen on the field of battle.

When ANVIL operatives attack, they will enter the police station through the Lobby [1], through the Back Entrance [26], through the Side Entrance [28] and through the skylights above the Office [5]. Roll to determine order.

FIST operatives will have just enough time to get into position in the police stationn but not enough time to get all the film crew together and secured before the ANVIL forces arrive. In the surprise attack, a few ANVIL forces will have managed to make it through into the police station to take hostages and get into position.

Roll for rooms where crew are located: {{< rpg_roll "1d28" >}}

Thankfully, FIST operatives are wearing high tech spy cameras with limited filming capacity that they can choose to turn on/off depending on how cool they think the "scene" that's about to happen is going to be.

The following map describes the state of the police station at the time of the attack. When in doubt, rooms contain whatever was left over after this police station fell out of use.
