# TLDR - what is the LoBG? to be revealed by early NPCs (like Lady Crucem Capilli)

- an Escheresque and irrational labyrinth, created by the Blue Goron, Illyria, to store the many strange and useful items (Lady Crucem Capilli is interested in these) she's collected throughout her aons of life and as an escape from her many terminally angry enemies.
- The Elephant King -> Rise of the Reptile Empire -> The brutal Triarchy rises with power of the Three Perfect Sisters -> Fall of the Reptile Empire -> Ashen Chanterelle breaks her way into the Maze but is imprisoned in a painting formed from her own portal -> stairs leading to the LoBG on Eliator treated as a kind of afterlife -> (a few hours ago) Lady Crucem Capilli enters the halls -> PCs enter the halls.
- A remnant of a long-gone civilization, the Triarchy, ruled three perfect sisters, Chronia, Charity, Zamia Torn, betrayed by a few obsessives in their empire leading to the world falling into bloody chaos, slightly worse than the bloody order provided by their government.
