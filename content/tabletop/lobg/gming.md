## Table - I Search The Body

For randomly encountered intelligent creatures. Roll once for every 3 HD of corpses.

Results below (80-00) only appear once. After that, cross them out and write in your own, or if you don't have time, give Gp=#rolled.

{{< rpg_table name="ISearchTheBody" weighted=true >}}
| D100 | You find… |
| -    | -         |
| 1-50 | Currency worth amount of GP shown on dice. |
| 51-56 | Small gems/trinkets worth d10 × creature level GP. |
| 57-59 | Key—GM roll d100: if it's 37 (for example), tell the player "It's key #37". It has a 37% chance of opening the next normally locked door in the Maze that it's used on. Once it gets used, that's the only door it works on. Don't tell the players that's how it works. |
| 60-64 | Day's rations. |
| 65-70 | Day's worth of fresh water. |
| 71-72 | Vial of holy or unholy water (as 50/50 or as appropriate to creature). |
| 73-78 | Partial and crappy dungeon map. To simulate it, any player is allowed to look at the GM's map for a number of seconds equal to their PC's intelligence divided by 2. |
| 79 | Lamp oil, flint & tinder, 3 torches. |
| 80 | Tiny petrified goblin child (gremlin) curled up to look like a small stone. If the Medusa dies, it re-animates, screams "Escape!", and runs away. If followed, it will lead PCs to the nearest safe exit. |
| 81 | Rolled up painting of an Alien Sun (20"x10"), emits slight light. If given to [Charity Torn](#charity-torn) or the [Glyph Witch](#aelfadred-the-glyph-witch), they will respond positively. Really ugly though, so worth only 150GP. |
| 82 | A fat gold coin marked with an eye on one side and a mouth on the other. On close examination this morphs into a little cyclopic gold homunculus of the same mass. A spy and servant for Torcul Wort (Wedding 191). Anything it sees, he sees; he can speak through its mouth. |
| 83 | An ancient, sealed letter or scroll with the nickname or childhood name of the PC that found it in a language they know. If examined it reads: "Dear [PC familiar name], I assume you are reading this after your encounter with [roll next Random Encounter and describe basics to PCs, i.e. ‘just after your encounter with Torgos Zooth']… if so you are only a little behind schedule. Obviously, her mask cracks mirrors, but I'm sure you've worked that out already. Try to keep up. Will see you at the end. –Levalliant G." Use the Encounter described in the letter as the next one; in fact, you may wish to trigger it as soon as the letter has been read. |
| 84 | A mummified human hand curled into a fist which has been stitched to the body of a snake, eye in the palm. (In fact this is Mr. Grasp from Almery pretending to be dead to spy on the PCs.) |
| 85 | A bag of salt and a note saying, in the common tongue: "It doesn't like this, use it to stop it getting back into the walls. Look out! It can come from ANYWHERE." |
| 86 | A dully-glowing Infrared Moth in a tiny cage. If released, it circles round the eyes of the greatest murderer in the room. |
| 87 | The body of a dead (stepped on) Pixie clutching in its hands a teeny-tiny letter. If examined via magic or a lens, the writer of this passive-aggressive message to "Ysanne" sounds very upset that Ysanne has fallen out of contact and asks about her sister and when they are coming home "though it's certainly no skin off my nose if you two do what you like. I have managed being alone quite well since your father passed away. Oh, I neglected to mention before, your father is dead. Yours, Mother." |
| 88 | Monocle with a bulging ceramic eye to weak comedic effect. This is, however, a vertical-pupilled Lizard eye. The wearer can read Ancient Saurian. The sight of this glass will anger and outrage any intelligent lizard-being, except Draco Scabra (Archive 160) who will find it HILARIOUS. |
| 89 | A note saying "possibly under the water-wheels but it's dangerous". |
| 90 | Magic user scroll: Deepwell (Level 3: turns a 3' diameter puddle of water into the surface of a deep vertical sea. Lasts 10 minutes.) |
| 91 | Magic user scroll: Steal Face (Level 4: Take and convincingly wear someone's face until it rots off or they get it back. Range: Touch.) |
| 92 | Scroll: Rust Object (3'x3'; patch becomes useless. Anyone can read it. Range: Touch.) |
| 93 | Bag of flour. |
| 94 | 10 x creature HD worth of trinkets. Infected with a virulent mold that'll spoil food in the pack in which it's stored in 1 hour. |
| 95 | Vial of lubricant: covers 6'x6' area. |
| 96 | Head of a morningstar. Light enough to throw. Coated in a substance which makes it smell like fresh meat; stupid carnivorous monsters may try to swallow it. |
| 97 | A form of waxy cosmetic made from crushed carmine beetles which can be applied to the lips. Using it and then kissing any object will cause a mouth to form wherever the kiss was. The new mouth will be sentient and can answer any questions that the object in question would be expected to know (if a living being is kissed, only the body part kissed will be able to speak) for d4 rounds before disappearing. The magic only works once, but the cosmetic itself is a sort of flattering muted rose and would look pretty good on you with maybe a slightly lighter foundation color. |
| 98 | Healing potion: d8 HP but pictographic label says it requires a finger from a dead humanoid to become active. |
| 99 | A Goblin Key that'll lock any door. |
| 100 | Pair of beads. Crushing bead A will instantly bring crusher to the location of bead B. |

{.table .table-bordered .table-sm}

- First attempts to possess the target (save every other round to expel) then force the body to commit most violent possible crimes.
- Otherwise, they will attack; their touch destroys gold. The target loses d4 × 100gp for every hit and takes d6 damage as the ghost slices, constricts, and burns them with radiation. This counts against any accumulated XP the PC would’ve received for gold acquired for the session in which the attack occurs, even if the XP was acquired in some other valuable currency.

Immunities as per undead; immune to normal weapons—though they are vulnerable to weapons that are magnetic or corrode metal.

Wants
: To get out of here. Protection.

Does Not Want
: To take any risks.

## Bondye Reparatè

The Bondye Reparatè repair heaven.

The job of servicing heaven earns serious status on the island of Elatior. Competition is hard and those performing it are effectively regarded as knights on the island. They are heavily trained and spiritually purified both before and after their journey.

The Priestesses of Elatior know that the most powerful Loa of Other World are all women, and the masks and costumes are to make sure that none of them show any interest in a man from Elatior. They live in terror of the idea of the Medusa or one of the Three Sisters falling in love with a mortal and pursuing them to earth. This is a reasonably sensible fear.

Looks
: group of strong, athletic youths dressed in robes. 
: wear stylized masks that are all individual but always portray the features of plain, almost ugly, women.

Behavior
: fix the Maze.
: keep lanterns fueled.
: deal with repairs.
: keep many of the occupants fed and supplied.
: do everything they can to keep the whole place stable.

- group composed of 2d4 of the bravest young men (Lvl 2) lead by one of the most cunning old men (INT 18).
- possess a wide range of basic repair tools, materials, some luxury consumables like rum and cigarettes. They also have carefully concealed machetes.
- If not directly threatened, will begin every encounter with an offering of either primitive cigarettes, fine rum, or food.
- they are all trained craftsman and will be happy to repair any clothing or tools.
- they will replace clearly missing or broken tools like-for-like. (If you break or lose your rope, they will bring you new rope, because you are meant to have it; they will not bring you any more than that.)
- They will also offer water and food if it seems needed.

Bondye Reparatè will never do any of the following:

- Offer violence first. “Great One, you are beyond my comprehension.”
- Intervene in a conflict between dungeon inhabit- ants. “Who can judge the Gods?”
- Give directions. “I will learn if you teach.”
- Give any information on any dungeon inhabit- ant. “If the eagle knows not the crow, shall the frog remind him?”
- Offer healing of any kind. “If a dog fears the night shall it drag the sun back into the sky?”
- Tell you anything about Elatior or even admit it exists. “I am from nowhere, I return to nowhere.”
- Take off the masks. “This is my face.”
- Give their names. “I am a slave, I am beneath your notice. My name is shame.”

If persistently questioned, they may direct PCs towards [Lady Nine-Bones](#lady-nine-bones) (Halls 17). Once PCs have made contact with Lady Nine-Bones, the results of that meeting affect all the Bondye Reparatè. They do what she does, they follow her lead, obey her instructions, and will avenge her death.

| AC | HD | ATK |

## Cackling Pranz

: To kill a thief.

Does Not Want
: To let one of the other five kill a thief and escape before them.

## Cadamosto
› Cells 283

Petrified prisoner of the Medusa. A lumpy, broadset monk who travelled with his master Dogon from a world on the brink of chaos after the disappearance of the Three Sisters and collapse of the Triarchy.

Wants
: To return the sisters to the world to ensure order and safety.

Does Not Want
: Anything to happen to Dogon.

## Calder Force
› Almery 258

A small and highly chaotic water demon. Hidden in a fountain by Levalliant Green.

Wants
: To free Aglinak from his fountain-prison then wreck shit.

Does Not Want
: Order.

## Cannibal Critic

Looks
: A variety of races and genders. Finely (if bloodily) clothed and somewhat sinewy (only the strongest individuals/cunningest have survived, the rest were eaten).
: Many were wanderers and adventurers seeking gold or the release of petrified prisoners, or descendants of Triarchy members or fools who broke into the LoBG from Elatior, lost and driven mad by the strangeness of the Maze.

Behavior
: Sounds likes a smoker / zombie, gurgly.
: Can no longer communicate in normal language but only howl bestial war cries of generic criticism.

Wants
: eat others
: study the strange works of art in the Gallery
: prevent non-critics from interacting with works of art in the Gallery
: follow [Blamphin](#nigellus-blamphin) and [Bon Clerk](#octavian-bon-clerk), two erudite consumers of human flesh who form as much government as the Cannibals are able to muster..

- Successfully answering a question of the Cannibal Critics will cause them to pause for a round and grunt amongst themselves before they scream another random question.
- They prefer to attack separated members of the group, subdue them, and carry them off to The Critical Faculty in Gallery 80 where they will be slowly boiled alive and asked detailed questions about aesthetics.
- They use broken glassware, serving forks, and long knives stolen from the Dead Wedding reception Wedding 177, or nets of human hair weighted with bone hooks.
- They have a stealth capacity of 3 in 6 (or 50%) but tend to believe they are hidden.

Does Not Want
: Any opposition from them to this idea.

: reclaim the Maze and its Archive for living Saurids.

- AKA "librarians" or "those fucking Chameleon Women"
- scouting parties and adventurers from the Neonate Empires
- **An organized and learning foe—any group you meet is in communication with others, is aware of your presence, and is part of an organized campaign to (among other things) eliminate you.**

- Suspicious of the Medusa (for being a part-mammal abomination) but willing to negotiate.
- Disturbed by the Saurid Mummies (for being their uncanny-valley undead ancestors) but willing to negotiate.

- **when rolled as a Random Encounter, they will not engage if they see the party**, but rather attempt to quietly track the party until their next encounter with something else, then attack when the party is in a weakened or delicate situation.
- They have **infravision**, their adaptable skins allow them to **maintain stealth on a 1–5 on a d6, and they climb walls as normal terrain**.
- Each party will have one sorceress who can cast any basic wizard or cleric spell (Lvls 1–5) at a hit point cost equal to 2 × the level of the spell. So Magic Missile (a 1st Lvl spell) would cost the sorceress 2 hit points.

## "Oku"
› Gardens 53

Ex-thieves led by Rinaldini Dodo driven mad by magical masks given to them by Aelfadred, and now believe themselves to be birds.

: wear Oku bird masks

Behavior
: bird masks give them power but make them go slowly mad
: believe they are mythic birds even when not wearing masks.
: 50% they will give themselves away with birdlike behavior, when not wearing a mask.
: having lost their leader Akerstrom (being sent to kill the Medusa), the remaining "Oku" are riven by factionalism and choice paralysis, easy for Aelfadred to manipulate. 
: when a group of "Oku" faces a complex/subtle choice, roll a d6. On 4+, they act sanely. Otherwise, the group breaks down into arguing factions and either does nothing or each proceeding a different way.

{.table .table-bordered .table-sm}

Skills of 4th Lvl thieves
: **Backstab**: If you hit a creature who is unaware of your attack, you deal level/2 extra weapon dice of damage.

Each has a single spell (see previous page) which they can cast as a Lvl 1 Magic User. Like a Magic User, they must rest 8 hours to recover their spell before they can cast it again.

### Encounter

To generate an encounter, roll 2d8 and count down the active “Oku” one by one. All of these “Oku” are present and the one counted last is the leader; the mission on the leader’s line is the mission the “Oku” are currently on.

When an “Oku” dies or become incapacitated for any reason, draw a line through their name and do not count them again. If they are still alive, they will be found recovering in Gardens 53.

If more “Oku” are rolled than are left, start back at the beginning again, assume new “Oku” rolled have the same spells and missions in the same order.

The results of particular interactions with PCs are more powerful than the results of this table. If PCs make a genuine enemy, or friend, that particular “Oku” will act accordingly no matter what the table says.

### Oku Spells

#### Unseen Servant

Duration
: 1 Hour

Range
: Far

This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

#### Spider Climb

Duration
: 1 Hour

Range
: Close

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.

#### Magic Missile

Duration
: Instant

Range
: Far

You have advantage on your check to cast this spell.

A glowing bolt of force streaks from your open hand, dealing 1d4 damage to one target.

#### Hold Portal

Duration
: 10 rounds

Range
: Near

You magically hold a portal closed for the duration. A creature must make a successful STR check vs. your spellcasting check to open the portal. The knock spell ends this spell.

#### Knock

Duration
: Instant

Range
: Near

A door, window, gate, chest, or portal you can see within range instantly opens, defeating all mundane locks and barriers.

This spell creates a loud knock audible to all within earshot.

#### Darkness

Duration
: 10 Minutes

Range
: Far

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

#### Shrink

Duration
: 1 Minute

Range
: Near

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

Reduce. The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category--from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

#### Sleep

Duration
: Instant

Range
: Near

You weave a lulling spell that fills a near-sized cube extending from you. Living creatures in the area of effect fall into a deep sleep if they are LV 2 or less. 

Vigorous shaking or being injured wakes them.

#### ESP

Duration
: 1 Round

Range
: Close

Detects the surface thoughts of any thinking creature in range. The caster can probe one creature per turn, getting simple thoughts, and probes can continue from round to round to see if the thoughts change. The ESP is stopped by 2 or more feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead foil. 

#### Web

Duration
: 5 rounds

Range
: Far

You create a near-sized cube of sticky, dense spider web within the spell’s range. A creature stuck in the web can’t move and must succeed on a Strength check vs. your spellcasting check to free itself.

#### Mirror Image

Duration
: 5 rounds

Range
: Self

You create a number of illusory duplicates of yourself equal to half your level rounded down (minimum 1). The duplicates surround you and mimic you.

Each time a creature attacks you, the attack misses and causes one of the duplicates to evaporate. If all of the illusions have disappeared, the spell ends.

#### Locate Object

Duration
: 10 Minutes

Range
: Self

Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object's location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close--within 30 feet--at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.

This spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.

#### Invisibility

Duration
: 10 rounds

Range
: Close

A creature you touch becomes invisible for the spell’s duration.

The spell ends if the target attacks or casts a spell.

#### Forget

Duration
: Permanent

Range
: Close

The targets forget the last 1 minute. This does not undo any spell or effect, but it may remove the memory of the casting from the target's mind. The caster chooses how many targets to affect -- if they affect only 2, the creatures take a -1 penalty on the save, if they affect only 1, the creatures take a -2 penalty on the save. The spell can be undone with a heal, restoration, or wish cast specifically to dispel this effect. 

#### Audible Glamer

Duration
: 2 Rounds

Range
: Close

The spell causes a sound to arise from a space within range, audible to any within the normal hearing range of the sound. This sound can be anything the caster desires, from talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, and running to a hoard of running rats to a roaring lion or a roaring dragon. The sound can be made to recede, approach, or remain fixed in place. Anyone hearing the sound who does not believe it can make a saving throw to hear no sound, or perhaps just a faint noise. The volume of sound is based on the level of the caster -- the caster can produce a volume equal to four people per caster level (a hoard of rats is equal to 8 people, a roaring lion is equal to 16, and a roaring dragon is equal to 24 -- the DM may base other sounds on this estimate). 

#### Change Self

Duration
: 2d6 Rounds + 2

Range
: Self

You coat yourself in an illusion that makes you appear up to 1 foot taller or shorter, thin, fat, or of moderate weight, appearing as any creature that shares your body shape (generally, humanoid).

This spell is a very able disguise in most circumstances, and it can augment a more physical disguise quite well, hiding flaws and structures effectively. The short duration means it is most useful for a quick bluff, and is unlikely to hold up to long-term scrutiny, or anything more than a visual appraisal.

: Fire. To take any responsibility for any revolution that might actually take place. To be found out as a revolutionary by the Lizardman Mummies.

## Levalliant Green
› Cells 291

## Lion In Lapis Lazuli
› Gallery 96

Intelligent and beautiful tiger sculpture.

**It thinks it’s a lion. Best not upset it.**

Wants
: You opinion on it. Your ruthlessly honest opinion.

Does Not Want
: To deal with the consequences of receiving it.

This intelligent and valuable tiger* composed of beautifully sculpted rare blue stone does not eat flesh, but can be dangerous none the less. It is extremely socially insecure; encounters with it often lead to violence.

The claws of the tiger grate on the floor of the Maze like brittle glass.

On contact, it will ask the PCs what they think of it. If they are not critical, it will circle them asking ever deeper and more complex questions. It will keenly follow any implied negative opinion. Should they admit to one, of any kind, it will—baffled, enraged, and genuinely surprised—assault them with prejudice.

## Lost Lizardman / Reptile Woman Mummy

There are several Reptile Mummies who could well have wandered away from their Archives (top left of the map) and gotten lost. Away from the music of the Seeping Chimes that fills that space and calms them, they may be frightened, irritable, and angry.

## Negamancer

The high-crested Negamancers of the Neonate Empire practice the philosophies of anticausality.

They are typically accompanied by an escort of Thrall Mammals, controlled with a pearl-white globe—if they are defeated, the Negamancer will retreat.

|-|-|-|
| 15  |   4   | d6 cursed knife + save or take 2 × damage next time you’re hit, or by spell |
{.table .table-bordered .table-sm}

Negamantic spells (line of sight, no save, at will):

- Undo effect last round of combat on himself
- Undo effect last round of combat on another
- Change one failed die roll into a critical fumble
- Transfer damage from one discrete attack from self to target

Thrall Mammals are mixed groups of moronic humans (some recruited from the ranks of the Cannibal Critics) and mandrils or other apes whose will to resist has been shattered by the Negamancer.

### Thrall Mammals

: grapple their targets en masse, targets find themselves surrounded by looming flowers smelling of home, lost loves, favorite drugs or food (they want to plunge their heads into the acid pits)
: slowly digest their victims over a most of a day, dissolving the body into the orchid-pit that gapes its radius to absorb them.

## Torgos Zooth

› Almery 256

A moon-headed Selenian, or Sub-Lunary man. Torgos loyally serves the Medusa as Archivist, guard, and interrogator.

Wants
: To serve and protect the Medusa.
: His sons back.

Does Not Want
: To betray the Medusa.
: His sons to be harmed.

Looks
: head is a moon that fills the room with pale white
light.
: The moon of his head is always the same shape
as the moon in the sky.
 

Behavior
: intelligent, perceptive, civilized, and—though rarely cruel—is a very ruthless man.
: and the strange power of its
light differs according to the stage the moon is in.
: If found abroad, he will almost certainly be seeking his kidnapped sons, Anole and Anolis (Archive 166), and will be willing to either employ or terrorize interlopers if he thinks it will help him find them.

If encountered outside his study in Almery 256, he will have with him his pet, the Armored Chem-Stoat “Overdose”, and “Mister Grasp”, a hideous creation formed from a severed hand, a dead man’s eye, and the body of a snake. Both will obey and serve him intelligently and without question.

His glance roots a target’s feet to the ground (no save). An uncomfortable squint teleports d4 people to random locations (save). Each is an action and cannot be done at the same time.

Detaching one’s own head is horribly impolite. But when crescent and in extremis, he can remove his and fling it like a boomerang. It returns to his hand on a miss. He can slash it like a saber, too.

Stealth 5 in 6.

The eye set into the withered palm acts as both a scrying device and a weapon. Torgos Zooth can see through this eye at will.

If anyone else should meet the gaze of Mr. Grasp:
