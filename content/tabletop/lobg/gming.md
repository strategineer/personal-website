# Bangs

1. Ashen Chanterelle encounters PCs: she tries to escape from her chains through any means and escape through the painting, locking the PCs in the LoBG.
2. Lady Crucem Capilli encounters PCs: she provides context on the LoBG and sends the PCs off to acquire art, artifacts or curios for her in exchange for handsome rewards.  
3. PCs damage/steal art: the Curator (big hand thing) becomes aware of them and begins to hound them.
4. Bondye Reparatè encounter PCs: they guide the PCs to Lady Nine-Bones (Halls 17) and she guides them subsequently to Elatior, a safehaven where the party can rest and recover between expeditions into the LoBG.
5. Chameleon Women encounter/discover PCs: they begin to gain strength, increasing HD with each subsequent encounter, and begin to inform the other denizens of the LoBG about the PCs actions if this would turn the NPCs against the PCs.
6. Okus encounter PCs: ...
7. (1 month after PCs enter the LoBG): Ashen Chanterelle will re-enter with a small force of mercenaries and the intention of persuading Chronia, Zamia and Charity to enter the world once more. The Medusa will oppose this.

# Dungeon Key

## Halls 1

To open the north door simply pull on the Ashen Chanterelle's chains, pick the lock, or smash it in. There is no key. But she, will do anything to stop you.

Arcane sconces can be removed from the walls and taken with PCs. They provide light as torches and go out at the same time. They can be "recharged" by being placed back on the walls in this room.

If PCs in the prison look back at the painting on the south wall, and examine it carefully, they will see, in the shadows of the room they have just left, a small pale boy who was not there before, Tyko Wort. If anyone goes to him and takes his hand Tyko can transport them instantly to the room with red pillars (Wedding 173).

### Ashen Chanterelle

"Help me! Please, I don't deserve to be in here..."

"I'm innocent, I'm a slave, my master the Blue Gorgon Illyria cursed me to guard her maze for the rest of eternity..."

Chained to the ceiling. Wants to escape her chains by any means (deceit, violence, charm, you name it) and go through the painting to the other world, taking the painting down and hiding it preventing anyone from following here.

The woman in chains is Ashen Chanterelle. Evil, abusive, deceptive and smart. All she wants is to escape into the moonlit room. She will tell PCs that freeing her will open the north door. She will devise any necessary lie. Her CHA is 18. Enchantments give false signals to those who perceive by magical means. She will pretend to be an innocent slave cursed to guard the Medusa’s Maze forever.

## Halls 2

### Lady Crucem Capilli

“It would be a shame,” she mutters to herself, “to burn it all, with nothing left behind”.

[info dump the basics of the LoBG](#tldr---what-is-the-lobg-to-be-revealed-by-early-npcs-like-lady-crucem-capilli)

Intro... "Ahh I see, a you might be just the kind of people I've been looking for! Welcome to the Labyrinth of the Blue Goron (lifts her arms up and spins around, fluttering her diminutive wings as she does) A place of wonder and beauty unlike anywhere else.

Who are you? "You call me Lady Crucem Capilli. I am a Dragon by birth, a Demon by trade and a lover, critic and collector of art, artifacts and curios of all kinds."

She will first offer to buy anything you bring back from the Maze. After the first transaction, roll d6 for each column on the table below to dis- cover what she wants next. If the party asks for information about the Maze to make their task easier, she’ll reply that their unknow- ing path through the Maze has its own aesthetic purity which she wouldn’t want to spoil.

Why are you in the Labyrinth? "A mix of pleasure and business... On that note, if you find any artifacts or curios in the Labyrinth please return them to me and I'll reward you handsomely for them."

## Weddings 173

100% safe room, random encounters will never occur here.

### Tyko Wort

Ghost, cannot communicate in any way.

If he finds you lost, he will try to lead you to safety.
