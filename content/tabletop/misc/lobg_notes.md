# House Rules

- When creating PCs, each one must be linked another character in some way (siblings? childhood friends? colleagues?). Ideally, each should be able to describe one memorable moment that occurred between them.
- PC death timers (1d4 + CON modifier rounds, min. 1), are kept secret by the GM from all players until another PC checks their pulse or tries to heal or stabilize them.
- Luck tokens are lost if not used at the end of every session. However, players can gain a luck token for the next session by providing the GM with their feedback for the session in the form of [Stars and Wishes](#stars-and-wishes) at the end of each session.

## Stars and Wishes

**Stars** are simple: Every involved person shall point to one item, person, or incident that they really enjoyed during the session. It could be "I really loved how you portrayed that Rat-Chaos-Mutant's speech, GM-Bob." or "Christy, your Barbarian was so cool when she burst through the door yelling bloody murder." Just name something that you really enjoyed.

**Wishes** are not so simple: It's formulating about what you like to see in the future. But it should be constructive.

For example "Please, no more zombies" is not a valid wish. You need to formulate your wish in a positive light on how to make things better. The wish for different enemies should be formulated in a way to what you want to face, not just what you don't want to face. "With all those zombies around, can we finally face the necromancer making them?" or "I think fighting a larger boss monster instead of just T-virus Zombies might be a nice change."

Wishes also allow asking changes that players can do or that were harming your fun in the game in a positive manner. "Christy, could you try to not yell your battle cry into my ear next time you do your battle cry?" At times it can be used to suggest things about things that affect the game but are not in the game entirely. "I'd like if you'd drop a note if you are late in the future" is a valid wish in this regard.

# Renamed characters

- The Blue Medusa, Psathyrella -> The Blue Gorgon, Illyria

# TLDR - what is the LoBG? to be revealed by early NPCs (like Lady Crucem Capilli)

- an Escheresque and irrational labyrinth, created by the Blue Goron, Illyria, to store the many strange and useful items (Lady Crucem Capilli is interested in these) she's collected throughout her aons of life and as an escape from her many terminally angry enemies.
- The Elephant King -> Rise of the Reptile Empire -> The brutal Triarchy rises with power of the Three Perfect Sisters -> Fall of the Reptile Empire -> Ashen Chanterelle breaks her way into the Maze but is imprisoned in a painting formed from her own portal -> stairs leading to the LoBG on Eliator treated as a kind of afterlife -> (a few hours ago) Lady Crucem Capilli enters the halls -> PCs enter the halls.
- A remnant of a long-gone civilization, the Triarchy, ruled three perfect sisters, Chronia, Charity, Zamia Torn, betrayed by a few obsessives in their empire leading to the world falling into bloody chaos, slightly worse than the bloody order provided by their government.

# Secrets & Clues

1. The mage who hires the crew initially to steal the painting is actually Lady Crucem Capilli. She's put a geas on the party compelling them to venture forth into the LoBG to help her achieve her goal of buying and preserving artifacts of many different kinds and to have people investigate the Maze, retrieve these for her, and bring back information.
2. Anyone who's been put into contact with the painting can't:
  - Leave the city of Astergrave (they turn back at the edge of the urban area and return to whatever they were doing previously, short-term amnesia is likely).
  - They can't talk to anyone about the painting unless they also know about the painting (the first and second rules of Fight Club).
3. The man, Sir August the Great, who's private collection used to contain the painting might want it back, if the crew starts acting weird in the city maybe he'll find them. He just likes the painting, he doesn't know that it's actually a portal into another world.

# NPCs


Npc, the collector,  tall gangly slender man with custom fit suit
 All he wants is something to remember this encounter by, he'll take it by force if needed. 


# Notes

## Session 0

- The group should gives themselves a name and this is what they'll be known as in the dungeon. 

## Session 1

- Lady Crucem Capilli should [info dump the basics of the LoBG](#tldr---what-is-the-lobg-to-be-revealed-by-early-npcs-like-lady-crucem-capilli) to the players and answer any questions they have. Also, she should ask them to retrieve artifacts for her.
