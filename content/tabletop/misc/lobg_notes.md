El Myster the mage tasked the party with stealing the art leading to the maze. The pay was good so they took the job. The party is compelled by a geas to explore the world of the painting and can't leave the city. But they can  or talk about the painting.  Anyone brought into the maze can't either with anyone who hasn't been. 

# Secrets & Clues

1. The mage who hires the crew initially to steal the painting is actually Lady Crucem Capilli. She's put a geas on the party compelling them to venture forth into the LoBG to help her achieve her goal of buying and preserving artifacts of many different kinds and to have people investigate the Maze, retrieve these for her, and bring back information.
2. Anyone who's been put into contact with the painting can't:
  - Leave the city of Astergrave (they turn back at the edge of the urban area and return to whatever they were doing previously, short-term amnesia is likely).
  - They can't talk to anyone about the painting unless they also know about the painting (the first and second rules of Fight Club).
3. The man, Sir August the Great, who's private collection used to contain the painting might want it back, if the crew starts acting weird in the city maybe he'll find them. He just likes the painting, he doesn't know that it's actually a portal into another world.
