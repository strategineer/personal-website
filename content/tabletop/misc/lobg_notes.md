# TODO

- fetch appropriate stat block from rulebook for all the npcs in the encounter tables

# House Rules

- When creating PCs, each one must be linked another character in some way (siblings? childhood friends? colleagues?). Ideally, each should be able to describe one memorable moment that occurred between them.
- PC death timers (1d4 + CON modifier rounds, min. 1), are kept secret by the GM from all players until another PC checks their pulse or tries to heal or stabilize them.
- Luck tokens are lost if not used at the end of every session. However, players can gain a luck token for the next session by providing the GM with their feedback for the session in the form of [Stars and Wishes](#stars-and-wishes) at the end of each session.

## Stars and Wishes

**Stars** are simple: Every involved person shall point to one item, person, or incident that they really enjoyed during the session. It could be "I really loved how you portrayed that Rat-Chaos-Mutant's speech, GM-Bob." or "Christy, your Barbarian was so cool when she burst through the door yelling bloody murder." Just name something that you really enjoyed.

**Wishes** are not so simple: It's formulating about what you like to see in the future. But it should be constructive.

For example "Please, no more zombies" is not a valid wish. You need to formulate your wish in a positive light on how to make things better. The wish for different enemies should be formulated in a way to what you want to face, not just what you don't want to face. "With all those zombies around, can we finally face the necromancer making them?" or "I think fighting a larger boss monster instead of just T-virus Zombies might be a nice change."

Wishes also allow asking changes that players can do or that were harming your fun in the game in a positive manner. "Christy, could you try to not yell your battle cry into my ear next time you do your battle cry?" At times it can be used to suggest things about things that affect the game but are not in the game entirely. "I'd like if you'd drop a note if you are late in the future" is a valid wish in this regard.

# Renamed characters

- The Blue Medusa, Psathyrella -> The Blue Gorgon, Illyria

# TLDR - what is the LoBG? to be revealed by early NPCs (like Lady Crucem Capilli)

- an Escheresque and irrational labyrinth, created by the Blue Goron, Illyria, to store the many strange and useful items (Lady Crucem Capilli is interested in these) she's collected throughout her aons of life and as an escape from her many terminally angry enemies.
- The Elephant King -> Rise of the Reptile Empire -> The brutal Triarchy rises with power of the Three Perfect Sisters -> Fall of the Reptile Empire -> Ashen Chanterelle breaks her way into the Maze but is imprisoned in a painting formed from her own portal -> stairs leading to the LoBG on Eliator treated as a kind of afterlife -> (a few hours ago) Lady Crucem Capilli enters the halls -> PCs enter the halls.
- A remnant of a long-gone civilization, the Triarchy, ruled three perfect sisters, Chronia, Charity, Zamia Torn, betrayed by a few obsessives in their empire leading to the world falling into bloody chaos, slightly worse than the bloody order provided by their government.

# Secrets & Clues

1. The mage who hires the crew initially to steal the painting is actually Lady Crucem Capilli. She's put a geas on the party compelling them to venture forth into the LoBG to help her achieve her goal of buying and preserving artifacts of many different kinds and to have people investigate the Maze, retrieve these for her, and bring back information.
2. Anyone who's been put into contact with the painting can't:
  - Leave the city of Astergrave (they turn back at the edge of the urban area and return to whatever they were doing previously, short-term amnesia is likely).
  - They can't talk to anyone about the painting unless they also know about the painting (the first and second rules of Fight Club).
3. The man, Sir August the Great, who's private collection used to contain the painting might want it back, if the crew starts acting weird in the city maybe he'll find them. He just likes the painting, he doesn't know that it's actually a portal into another world.
4. ...

# Menu of bangs

1. Ashen Chanterelle encounters PCs: she tries to escape from her chains through any means and escape through the painting, locking the PCs in the LoBG.
2. Lady Crucem Capilli encounters PCs: she provides context on the LoBG and sends the PCs off to acquire art, artifacts or curios for her in exchange for handsome rewards.  
3. PCs damage/steal art: the Curator (big hand thing) becomes aware of them and begins to hound them.
4. Bondye Reparatè encounter PCs: they guide the PCs to Lady Nine-Bones (Halls 17) and she guides them subsequently to Elatior, a safehaven where the party can rest and recover between expeditions into the LoBG.
5. Chameleon Women encounter/discover PCs: they begin to gain strength, increasing HD with each subsequent encounter, and begin to inform the other denizens of the LoBG about the PCs actions if this would turn the NPCs against the PCs.
6. Okus encounter PCs: ...
7. (1 month after PCs enter the LoBG): Ashen Chanterelle will re-enter with a small force of mercenaries and the intention of persuading Chronia, Zamia and Charity to enter the world once more. The Medusa will oppose this.

# NPCs

## the collector

tall gangly slender man with custom fit suit
 All he wants is something to remember this encounter by, he'll take it by force if needed. 

# Room Keys - My Notes

## Halls 1

To open the north door simply pull on the Ashen Chanterelle's chains, pick the lock, or smash it in. There is no key. But she, will do anything to stop you.

Arcane sconces can be removed from the walls and taken with PCs. They provide light as torches and go out at the same time. They can be "recharged" by being placed back on the walls in this room.

If PCs in the prison look back at the painting on the south wall, and examine it carefully, they will see, in the shadows of the room they have just left, a small pale boy who was not there before, Tyko Wort. If anyone goes to him and takes his hand Tyko can transport them instantly to the room with red pillars (Wedding 173).

### Ashen Chanterelle

"Help me! Please, I don't deserve to be in here..."

"I'm innocent, I'm a slave, my master the Blue Gorgon Illyria cursed me to guard her maze for the rest of eternity..."

Chained to the ceiling. Wants to escape her chains by any means (deceit, violence, charm, you name it) and go through the painting to the other world, taking the painting down and hiding it preventing anyone from following here.

The woman in chains is Ashen Chanterelle. Evil, abusive, deceptive and smart. All she wants is to escape into the moonlit room. She will tell PCs that freeing her will open the north door. She will devise any necessary lie. Her CHA is 18. Enchantments give false signals to those who perceive by magical means. She will pretend to be an innocent slave cursed to guard the Medusa’s Maze forever.

## Halls 2

### Lady Crucem Capilli

“It would be a shame,” she mutters to herself, “to burn it all, with nothing left behind”.

[info dump the basics of the LoBG](#tldr---what-is-the-lobg-to-be-revealed-by-early-npcs-like-lady-crucem-capilli)

Intro... "Ahh I see, a you might be just the kind of people I've been looking for! Welcome to the Labyrinth of the Blue Goron (lifts her arms up and spins around, fluttering her diminutive wings as she does) A place of wonder and beauty unlike anywhere else.

Who are you? "You call me Lady Crucem Capilli. I am a Dragon by birth, a Demon by trade and a lover, critic and collector of art, artifacts and curios of all kinds."

She will first offer to buy anything you bring back from the Maze. After the first transaction, roll d6 for each column on the table below to dis- cover what she wants next. If the party asks for information about the Maze to make their task easier, she’ll reply that their unknow- ing path through the Maze has its own aesthetic purity which she wouldn’t want to spoil.

Why are you in the Labyrinth? "A mix of pleasure and business... On that note, if you find any artifacts or curios in the Labyrinth please return them to me and I'll reward you handsomely for them."

## Weddings 173

100% safe room, random encounters will never occur here.

### Tyko Wort

Ghost, cannot communicate in any way.

If he finds you lost, he will try to lead you to safety.


# Session Notes / Room Key Changes
