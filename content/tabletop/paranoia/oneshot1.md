Here's the notes I prepped for my first Paranoia one-shot I GMed. I've been reading up and thinking about Old School Renaissance RPG systems and settings for a few weeks and you can see the influence of that here.

<!--more-->

The session went well but the use of mutant cockroaches as one of the factions acted as a pretty strong railroad to encourage players to side with the human workers due to the setting. That wasn't the intention. I wanted to players to really have a choice between siding with the humans factory workers, the cockroaches (and maybe even the robots).

If I were to run this again, I would swap out the cockroaches and instead have two human Infrared human factions (the Laborers and the Office Workers) fighting with each other, neither of which are communists but both of which believe they have better ideas about how to increase the factory's efficiency. Or something like that.

Another problem was that I didn't prep any way to reveal the map properly as the players ran through it. I just took screenshots of sections of the map as they were revealed. Mas suggested I use an image manipulation program with two layers that I could gradually reveal. That would have been way better.

Or I could use a VTT (probably something simple like https://www.owlbear.rodeo/), but that requires a bit more setup. I would use tonly do that if it's really important for PCs to be physically positioned in specific places with stat-based or effect-based restrictions on movement.

Another thing was that I did write down some events that happened during the course of play to bring up during the mission debriefing at the end of the session. The mission debriefing was a fun part of the session but it might been better to also write down a note any time the Computer die came up. Those moments in particular will be remembered by the players and me and tended to be pretty comical. So remembering to bring them up in during the debriefing would have been fun.

Another thing. The special R&D homonym-based equipment I came up with was fun but I should have looked around for some more inspiration, maybe some tables of funny equipment I could have used online.

# Character creation

While the players are doing the following steps, the GM should generate the jobs and secret roles for the players using [this tool](/bin/paranoia/) and DM them the results (NB: the first card is public information, the other two are secret.)

- Right click and download the [character sheet](/decks/paranoia.html).
- Click the "Randomize" button on the bottom right of the screen.
- Look at the stats and skills then give your character an appropriate punny name.
- Click on File and Save As... and save another file for this sheet.
- Upload the sheet to discord and give it to another player, they'll play be playing the character you generated.

# Tutorial

PCs begin play:

**You find yourself in a dark instructional video viewing room. You're strapped in to your seats and your eyelids are being pulled back by some sort of device with their eyelids watching a series of instructional videos telling them some of what they need to know to succeed at being troubleshooter.**

{{< quote >}} Welcome troubleshooters to your first day troubleshootings. You find yourselves in the Alpha Complex. It's something like Portal's Aperture Science Facility but instead of an underground facility for just doing science, it's supposed to be a completely enclosed ecosystem/world.

The facility is managed by an all-seeing Computer (The Computer), think Glados but more british.

You are playing as new troubleshooters, it's your first day on the job. A troubleshooter's role is to deal with any problems that come up in the Alpha Complex. As players, you know that the Alpha Complex is falling apart and in a constant state of disrepair. The Computer is no longer capable of maintaining the facility and it doesn't understand why. The Computer has ratched up the surveillance state and blames everyone but itself for the Alpha Complex's problems.

Remember the following:

1. The Computer is infallible. The Computer is recording everything you see through your implants however it only focuses on what you're doing specifically when it hears gunfire, explosions, the word "Treason" or whenever it feels like it.
2. Being a Mutant or a Traitor is punishable by death. Secret Societies are treasonous.
3. You can only be tried for a crime once (clones aren't punished by other clones's crimes).

{{< /quote >}}

Colonel Kernel (old haggard military man, white hair, beret, yellow clearance) enters the room, salutes the group of newly minted troubleshooters, gives the players their iLiveToServe device, gives minimal hints and leaves room for questions.

Players are given the illusion of choice and presented with three missions through their service device (they can only pick one), players go to R&D department and meet Jefferson, the R&D technician, who assigns everyone on major tool but they aren't allowed to test out their equipmennt before they're in the field. Jefferson will ask them to report back to R&D HQ with their in-field testing results.

# Mission

## Main Mission

A bit of a "dungeon crawl" in the soy sauce factory and adjacent buildings in District NOOB.

Players enter through the Main lobby at 4.

### Factions

- Factory Workers: Infrared level humanoid workers who are managerial staff.
- Cockroach revolutionaries: bio-engineered cockroaches who are subservient to the human factory workers who both: work in the factory AND are the input product of the factory itself. Sentient giant cockroaches are turning other sentient giant cockroaches into soy sauce (or something that looks and tastes like it).
- Robot maintenance and security workforce: They clean, they protect the factory from bad actors and their programming has been messed with by the Cockroach revolutionaries so their behavior is erratic.

### Solutions

- Kill the humans and let the cockroaches take over the factory (they can extrete soy sauce from their bodies OR they can turn the humans into vinegar).
- Re-Subjugate the cockroaches, killing any who refuse to work, under the human management.

### NPCs

- The Secretary - Ingrid: very old, extremely tired. She acts as though everything is business as usual in the factory, she's aware of a commotion but not of any details: "The big wigs never tell me anything!".
- The Worker - John: young, excited to be alive. He was assigned a later shift today and is getting ready to start his day. He's blissfully unaware of any issues in the factory.
- The Janitor - Ahti: nordic, weird, talks with a thick accent. Says absolute nonsense and is always moping the floor.
- The Manager - Bob: balding, white, upper management vibes, likes to tell people what to do, shitting his pants. Locked in the factory's secret recipe vault, with cockroaches trying to get in there.
- Che Gueroacha: beret wearing leader of the giant cockroaches, wanders through the factory.
- Jenny - The Mysterious Stranger: grey (illegal) old troubleshooter who's come to support the cockroaches with their revolution. The Computer is blind to her due to a piece of a equipment she carries.
- iClean Unit 123ABC - A giant roomba with various cleaning appendages tasked with cleaning the factory under normal circumstances. Compulsively cleans from room to room, to converse with it the group will need to follow it.

### Map

![](/img/tabletop/paranoia/bug_factory.png)

This map represents the walkable floor area of the factory but conveyors and walkways allow for soy sauce and raw materials throughout the factory.

1. Security Checkpoint: Goods move between the Loading Bay (5) and the Main Processing Area (2) through here. Empty.
2. Main Processing Area: Floor is thick with brown liquid, broken down robots and dead workers. A single iClean unit remains, although heavily damaged. As well as a trio of revolutionary cockroaches.
3. Janitor's Office: The Janitor Ahti is here. He's sweeping the floor, he knows everything there is to know about everything but communicates it terribly.
4. Entrance - Main lobby: The Secretary Ingrid greets the troubleshooters with: "If you're here for our Alpha Complex famous guest tours of the factory, I'm sorry to inform you that we're not doing those anymore. How can I help you?"
5. Loading Bay: Raw materials are brought into the factory here and finished product is sent out. Some human workers are fighting off red beret-wearing Che Gueroacha and his revolutionaries.
6. Offices: Desks, chairs and computers with dividers between them all. A mess.
7. Worker Locker Room: The Worker John is here. The locker room is clean and doesn't betray the fact that the factory is kind of fucked up right now. If the troubleshooters loot the lockers, that's theft.
8. Break Room: Zezeticktick is here. Hot brown liquid dispensing room. Zeze is a species traitor is wearing business casual attire and trying to get some hot brown liquid inside him however the machine is empty.
9. Janitor's Recharging Zone: Sounds can be heard coming from within this room. An iClean robot is recharging its batteries after a long "cleaning" session (blood and guts and soy sauce is all over it).
10. Secret Recipe Factory Vault (Locked): The Manager Bob (balding) has locked himself in there and can't get out. A small group of giant cockroaches are trying to get in the door.
11. Entertainment Room: A glass (bulletproof) square case filled with prizes with a lever on the outside and a mechanical claw on the inside. Needs special coins (SoyCoins) to operate, human factory workers have them.
12. Shower Room: Troubleshooters need to stay clean.

## Extra Ideas

- Bug infestation in the soy sauce factory, the bugs bleed soy sauce? Actually it's a revolt by the bugs who are tired of being squeezed for their juice.
- Which leads the troubleshooters to the nearest laundromat
- Sentient laundry machine tries to launder people.
- Which leads the troubleshooters on a goose chase all over the city to find previously non sentient machines becoming sentient and filled with rage
- A particular brand of companion robot all across the alpha complex needs to be recalled, they won't come willingly. Glojob123, fluorescent sex robots that do everything to advertise their services (NB: They kill their clients).
