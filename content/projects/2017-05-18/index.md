I worked at Borealys Games, an independent video game studio, from May 2016 until November 2017. I mostly worked on Mages of Mystralia but I also worked on other unannounced/cancelled projects.

We were two/three programmers working on Mages of Mystralia ([Anthony Demange](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonydemange/) as lead programmer and [Vincent Bilodeau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentbilodeau/) as graphics programmer).

On Mages of Mystralia, I touched almost everything given the small size of the team but I focused specifically on these parts of the game:

- Responsible for multiplatform development; worked on infrastructure and optimization for PS4 and Xbox One ports.
- Responsible for API integration and build automation for PC, PS4, Xbox One et Steam.
- Developed UI using 3D effects and supporting controller, keyboard and mouse.
- Developed several gameplay systems.
- Developed editor and real-time debugging tools.
