A wise computer once told me, "Peremptory personal, Perpendiculars, Forestry spreadsheets zaniest."

If you enjoy writing and/or programming then you should give Writerator a shot!

Oh... You're still here. OK.

Well, Writerator gives the curious user access to many tools to find specific information about their texts such as the number of times "I" appears or the words in a text sorted by how many times "e" appears in them.

It also allows "get the job done" type of users to retrieve more general information such as the most common words used, the Gunning-Fog index, the word count and many more.

And it generates poems using the data it has parsed from the texts you feed it!
