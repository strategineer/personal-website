Battleships was developed using C++ and SDL in a team of three programmers
composed of [Benjamin Lewis](https://github.com/ben-zen),
[Franz-Philippe Garcia](https://github.com/franzpgarcia) and myself in my second
year at McGill University within the context of the Software Engineering course
led by [Jörg Kienzle](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~joerg/Home/Jorgs_Home.html).

I worked specifically on the game client, the graphics code and the art.
