<blockquote class="blockquote">
You are the Black Box Bandit. You travel through the Interwebs and destroy the black boxes of the Utech corporation's computer systems. <BR>
You do so, because Utech's firm grip on modern society is unsettling. You do so, because of Utech's global banning of muffins, your favorite dessert, which forced you to the brink of civilized society to satisfy your muffin cravings. <BR>
I am Jack The Muffin Man, the world-renowned human-muffin hybrid and revolutionary. And, you, my friend, are the hammer that will strike at the heart of Utech and bring forth the Muffinpocalypse. <BR>
