Dear Billguk,<BR>


Today, our Guk leaders have decided to lead their fellow Guks into battle against the hated Surfacers. <BR>


Billguk, I'm calling upon you now to perform the duty you've trained for your entire life. <BR>


I ask you to show your fellow Guks that the Invasion Logistics Professional diploma on your bedroom wall actually means something. <BR>
