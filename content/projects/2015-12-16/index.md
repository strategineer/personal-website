Great Turtle Adventure IV was developed using a custom game engine I designed and built (with DirectX 10 and PhysX) inspired by the [game engine](https://github.com/DDJV-INF740/GameEngine-src) built by [Gaspard Petit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaspardpetit/) and the DirectX 10 knowledge provided by François Jean during my first semester in the DDJV program at the University of Sherbrooke (Campus Longueuil).

The project was completed mostly by myself with the help of [Mathieu Langlois](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieu-langlois-a019a1100) and [Dominique Lacombe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lacombe-dominique/) who helped me close the project in the last couple of days before the deadline.

I took an ax to the existing game engine and 3D rendering code we were given and built it my own way to support our project specifically. Also, I built was a post-effect shader manager allowing us to create the opening cinematic of the game in which the turtle wakes up from a nap and dazes lazily at the sun (I don't think turtles can actually do that but hey).
