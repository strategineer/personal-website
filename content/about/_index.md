Welcome!

My name is Bill Tyros, though you might know me online as _strategineer_. I'm a software engineer by trade, with a lifelong love for sharing thoughts in writing.

Here on my website, I post musings on my favorite hobbies: video gaming, reading, and—most recently—tabletop roleplaying. 

### Background
I've lived in Laval, a cozy city near Montreal (Quebec, Canada), ever since I arrived on the scene in the early '90s. I'm fluent in English and French. 

Gaming and reading have been my passions for as long as I can remember. Initially, they offered an escape from life's rougher edges. Over the years, I've started engaging with games and media through a more critical lens—an approach that's led to more meaningful experiences and conversations.
