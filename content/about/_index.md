Welcome!

My name's Bill Tyros, also known as strategineer in some online spaces, I'm a software engineer by trade and I've always enjoyed writing my thoughts down.

I use this website to share my thoughts on a few of my passions including video gaming, reading and, most recently, tabletop roleplaying.

A little about me: I grew up and have lived in Laval (a small city near Montreal, Quebec, Canada) ever since I appeared on the scene in the early 90s. I'm fluent in English, French and I can understand a little Spanish.

I've been a voracious gamer and reader for most of my life. Early on these passions were a means of escaping the harsh realities of a difficult childhood --- in the past few years, I began engaging in these passions with a more critical media literacy focused lens. As a result, I've been able to have many more meaningful media-related experiences.

I love chatting about media and playing tabletop roleplaying games. If you'd like to contact me, you can:
