To consume (food) is to be human

Aubut is a paradise on Earth

It is a grocery store that caters to, well, caterers and restaurants but also the common folk.

It has everything you might want to have in your kitchen.

There's a few "trap" products that are being sold for twice as much as they should be but there's a of good deals and a lot of products that you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else.

Cafeterias and restaurants are accused of buying frozen meals off the shelf and reheating them to serve to customers. They have to in some circumstances to serve the volume of customers they get.

Well, that might be true. Aubut allows me to cut out the middlemen and just buy these premium frozen meals like (meat/fish pies) and throw them into my oven for a fraction of the price.
