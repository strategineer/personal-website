With more and more games flooding the market, there's more and more games vying for the attention of gamers.

There's more and more people playing games but for whatever reason, people tend to flock to the same few games (Fortnite, cough) and whatever else is popular right now in the mobile market.

This leaves smaller, and often more interesting, multiplayer games off the wayside. These games rely on a healthy supply of players to allow for short matchmaking times and fairer matches between evenly skilled players and to provide a consistent source of cash to support the continued development of the game.

I've fallen in love with many interesting, and now dead, multiplayer games. Here's a list of them followed by my thoughts on what made these games special to me. I'll finish by discussing my new favorite, but probably soon to be dead, game: Rumbleverse.

# Artifact

On its surface, Artifact was a DOTA themed digital card game developed by Valve in collaboration with Richard Garfield, the designer of Magic the Gathering.

In reality, it was actually just Magic the Gathering 2.0. Artifact took all the design problems inherent to Magic, resolved them and applied a thin coat of DOTA theming on top of it all. In the process, Artifact became the best digital card game ever created.

Unfortunately, not everyone felt the same way (if they did then we wouldn't be writing this, I would probably be playing Artifact) for a variety of legitimate (and not so legitimate) reasons.

The core issue that we'll see time and time again is that they created the perfect game for me, but if a game is perfect for me I've found that it's unlikely that the vast majority of gamers will feel the same way.

I'm not a special snowflake, I just have a particular set of tastes and these are not shared with most gamers, leaving me cursed to suffer through discovering the greatest multiplayer games ever made and watching them die over and over again.

Now, let's talk about another dead game (despite its title): Chaos Reborn.

# Chaos Reborn

Chaos Reborn is a modern evolution of Julian Gollop's (the creator of XCOM) 1985 game Chaos: The Battle of Wizards.

It's a turn-based strategy game about wizards summoning monsters to do their bidding and casting spells to cause havoc and damage to opposing wizards.

What makes the game unique, and gives it the unique risk management style gameplay that I love and that Julian Gollop is known for from his work on the original XCOM games, is the fact that each spell has a percentage chance of success to be cast.

The more powerful a spell, the harder it's going to be for you to cast it succesfully.

On its own, this feature isn't exciting or interesting. But, when cast a spell to summon a monster, you can choose to cast the monster as an illusion which means that the spell will have a 100% chance of success.

Illusion monsters are exactly the same as monsters cast normally with one key difference: enemy wizards can spend a turn to try to dispel any of your monsters, if the monster they try to dispel is an illusion it dissapears and they can continue their turn otherwise they lose their turn entirely.

And so, this makes the entire game work. You're always going to be at the edge of your seat, thinking really hard about which monsters if any are illusions and which aren't and how you're to respond to this in order to survive and be the last wizard standing.

It's amazing.

It's a game in which you'll be spending a lot of time activating your neurons, like a lot of these games actually.

Now let's talk about another game involving the use of a lot of brainpower: Frozen Cortex.
