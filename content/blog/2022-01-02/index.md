  hosts stopped making new episodes. They say that one of the hosts probably
  quit, and that the podcast is probably now dead."

Each day I take off work is a pleasure, but each passing day off increases the
sense of dread I feel about having to go back to work.

No matter how much I love my job, like most people, I would rather be spending
time with family and friends or working on hobbies that tend to be a little more
creatively fulfilling.

The passage of time is inevitable. Life's short and no one can escape death.

Unless you're the protagonist of The Forgotten City, a time loop game where
you're sent back in time to a microcosm of a Roman city afflicted with a deadly
curse and are tasked with lifting the curse and saving everyone.

Unfortunately, I am not the protagonist of the Forgotten City, and so I'm now
suffering from a massive headache caused by me staying awake until 4am in the
morning trying to solve the mystery of this masterfully crafted game.

What is the curse? If anyone commits a crime in the city, everyone turns into a
gold statue and dies. The inhabitants of the city call it the Golden Rule. This
has happened before and it'll happen again. Thankfully, something (or someone)
has brought you back in time (2000ish years ago) to the city to try and break
the cycle of suffering.

As a time travelling detective, you need to talk with the citizens, stop them
from committing crimes while unraveling the mystery of the city and its Golden
Rule in a desperate attempt to save everyone and return back to your future.

We can't all be time travelling detectives but you won't regret spending a few
hours of your life roleplaying as one in the Forgotten City.

I can't say much more about the game without spoiling parts of it that are
better experienced on your own. But if you're looking to play through one of the
best interactive stories ever made then you owe it to yourself to take a look at
this game.

As Seneca the Younger once said:

> "Sometimes even to live is an act of courage."

Go, live and play this amazing game.
