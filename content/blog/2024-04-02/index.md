I haven't written a blog post in around a year and a half. I've been spending all of my writing energy on journaling off and on and writing thoughts on the books I'm reading.

I'm not really in the mood to write about too much right now but here's a list of some of the books I've read in the past year and a half and my thoughts on them.

If you're not a big reader, you're missing out. Audiobooks are great if you're more into listening to rather than reading a book. If money is an issue, if you look hard enough you can find anything online for cheap and/or free.

The following books are all fantastic and I would recommend all of them to most people. If you're intrigued by the little blurb I've written here, click on the link and read some more of my thoughts. Maybe I can convince you to actually pick up and read one of these books.

[The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe](/books/2024-02-11/). A science fiction fantasy novel with a narrator who's trying his best to tell the story of how he came to power. For a series with such an uninspired premise, it is so wild and a must read for anyone interested in complex stories that are begging to be read multiple times over.

[Guards! Guards! by Terry Pratchett](/books/2023-11-13/). Another satirical fantasy novel for people who don't like fantasy novels. All of Terry Pratchett's work is great but this is one of his most popular works for good reason. It's funny as hell.

[Blindness by Jose Saramago](/books/2023-10-20/). Everyone (except the POV character) is going blind, hijinks ensues. Probably the most readable of Jose Saramago's work despite his refusal to name characters or use quotation marks in any of his work. Jose Saramago continuously surprises me with his writing. It's not always great but it's always interesting.

[Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins](/books/2023-09-21/). It's a book for kids about the holocaust, war crimes and depression. I've read this book twice as an adult and I'm expecting to read through the entire series again eventually. I'm so impressed by how good this book is, and how much effort was put into making it enjoyable to read no matter how old you are.

[Cassandra in Reverse by Holly Smale](/books/2023-06-17/). A fantastic novel about an autistic character fascinated with Greek Mythology who can control time. The way autism is portrayed generally in media is awful, reading an amazing book with a true to life portrayal of autism was such a pleasure.

So ya, that's about it. You can expect me to continue to share more of my thoughts on the books I read.

If you read anything I recommend or have anything to recommend me, let me know! I'm always looking forward to talk about books with people.
