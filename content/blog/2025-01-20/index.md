Roll for 1 pitch or if you're feeling wild, roll for 2 of them and combine them.

{{< rpg_table name="idea" >}}
| d100 | Elevator Pitch |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Naughty kids are on the rise --- you're Santa Clause's manliest (in a toxic way) elves sent to deal with this threat once and for all. |
| 2 | The IGKBA (Intergalactic Kaiju Battle Association) is looking to add Earth to their expanding roster of venues --- you're up and coming kaiju wranglers trying to make a name for yourself within an organisation that cares little for its workers and less for the people who get crushed by Kaiju. |
| 3 | In the small western town of Minnisauter, a group execution is a weekly event led by a corrupt sherriff who's secretary helps making sure people have paid for their seats --- you're the people being executed. |
| 4 | Everyone is dead --- you come back as as mischievous ghosts pulling pranks on the locals who you have grievances with. |
| 5 | The circus is back in town but every performers's got a problem that needs solving --- you're the circus interns for the summer. |
| 6 | An anime tournament (arc) is about to start --- you're the understaffed, underpayed, underappreciated tournament organisers. |
| 7 | The Corporation has spent most of their funds on the experimental research being done at the Laboratory --- you're the escaped experiments. |
| 8 | There's a big party being planned to celebrate someone's birthday --- you're throwing the party but you're banned from the grocery stores nearby and there's a bounty on your head. |
| 9 | There's a scummy CEO somewhere out there with a bounty on their head --- you have to claim the bounty but you have no relevant skills. |
| 10 | Dun dun dun dun duuuun duuuuun dun dun dun dun dun dun. Get the launch codes, infiltrate the nuclear launch facility, launch the nukes at ___ --- you're the janitorial staff of a rival nuclear launch facility. |
| 11 | Kids love pet rocks, they always have and they always will --- you're immortal sentient pet rocks, sometimes you've crossed paths with other immortal sentient pet rocks, tell us your stories. |
| 12 | The show's in an hour but the band doesn't have any instruments, the singer's voice was stolen, the drummer is too drunk to bang on the drums, the bassist is too depressed to do anything --- you're fans of the band and the penalty for a bad musical performance these days is death by cringe, save the band! |
| 13 | As we all know, believing hard enough in something makes it real --- you're skeptics going house to house to convert believers to your cause.  |
| 14 | The decades-long plan you've worked your entire life towards is on the cusp of completion --- you're queer, complete the gay agenda. |
| 15 | A necromancer has built a new tower and plans to send his necromantic forces against the nearby forces of conservatism --- you're raised skeletons sent on a raid looking to switch sides. |
| 16 | A drunk medium at a dinner party made a prophecy about the host's shitty love life, souring the vibes of the party --- you're friends of the host, save the party.  |
| 17 | A kid falls down a well and finds themselves in a topsy-turvy Alice in Wonderland-esque otherworldy world (see {{< book_url "Troika!" >}} for a system that would be good for this) --- you're a group of adventurers who've gone after them. |
