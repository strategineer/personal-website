<!--more-->

Roll for 1 pitch or if you're feeling wild, roll 2 of them and mix them together.



{{< rpg_table name="idea" >}}
| d100 | Elevator Pitch |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | naughty kids are on the rise --- you're Santa Claus's manliest (in a toxic way) elves sent to deal with this threat once and for all |
| 2 | the IGKBA (Intergalactic Kaiju Battle Association) is looking to expand their business to Earth --- you're up and coming kaiju wranglers, keep the crowds entertained otherwise you'll be sent down to die on the planet |
| 3 | a group execution is a weekly event in the small western town of Minnisauter, a corrupt sherriff and their secretary fetches peoples tickets --- you're the people being executed |
| 4 | all the PCs died --- they come back as mischievious ghosts pulling pranks on the locals |
| 5 | the circus is back in town but every perfomers got a problem that needs solving --- you're the interns |
| 6 | an anime tournament (arc) is about to start --- you're the understaffed, underpayed, underappreciated tournament organisers |
| 7 | escape from the laboratory --- you're the escaped experiments and the Corporation has spent too much money on you to let you escape |
| 8 | there's a big party being planned to celebrate somebody's birthday --- you've been asked to throw the party, the problem is that you're all banned from all the grocery stores nearby and there's a bounty on your heads |
| 9 | conduct a contract hit on a scummy CEO --- you have no relevant skills |
| 10 | get the launch codes, infiltrate the nuclear launch facility, launch the nukes at ___ --- you're the janitorial staff of the facility |
| 11 | kids love pet rocks, they always have and they always will --- you're sentient pet rocks, there are moments when you've crossed paths with other sentient pet rocks, tell us! |
| 12 | the show's in an hour but the band don't have their instruments, the singer's voice was stolen, the drummer is too drunk to bang on the drums, the bassist is too depressed --- you're fans of the band and you know that the penalty for a bad musical performance show is death by cringe, save the band! |
| 13 | As we all know, believing hard enough in something makes it real --- you're skeptics going house to house to convert believers to your cause.  |
| 14 | The decades-long plan you've worked your entire life towards is on the cusp of completion --- you're queer, complete the gay agenda |
| 15 | ... |
