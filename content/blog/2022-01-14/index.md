  "Essentially, this is about a person who enjoys writing and does it for fun,
  despite the fact that few people read it. The person writing this doesn't care
  what other people think about their writing, because they are intrinsically
  motivated to do it."

Every couple of weeks, my friend L decides that it's time to remind me of the
"small" number of people who actively read the writing I do here.

Here's why I don't care.

We're all influenced by a mix of _intrinsic_ and _extrinsic_ motivations that
determine how we choose to spend our time.

> "[Intrinsic motivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Intrinsic_and_extrinsic)
> exists within the individual and is driven by satisfying internal rewards
> rather than relying on external pressures or extrinsic rewards. It involves an
> interest in or enjoyment of the activity itself. For example, an athlete may
> enjoy playing football for the experience, rather than for an award."[^1]

I enjoy the process of writing itself. Finding the right words and putting them
in the right order to best express myself is inherently enjoyable. It's a
challenging puzzle, and I enjoy solving it.

Writing helps me to understand myself better and how I feel about life and the
media I consuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuume.

Even if I'm the last man on Earth, I would take the time out of my busy schedule
(someone's got to repopulate the Earth, if not me then who) to write because I
enjoy doing it, writing that is.

Do people think that I would spend more than half a decade of my life writing
for free for a handful of readers (I love you all!) for no reason in particular?

I do it because it's fun.

> "Extrinsic motivation occurs when an individual is driven by external
> influences. These can be either rewarding (money, good grades, fame, etc.) or
> punishing (threat of punishment, pain, etc.). The distinction between
> intrinsic and extrinsic motivation lies within the driving force behind the
> action. When someone is intrinsically motivated, they engage in an activity
> because it is inherently interesting, enjoyable, or satisfying. With extrinsic
> motivation, the agent's goal is a desired outcome distinct from the activity
> itself."[^1]

I also enjoy writing because I know that spending time writing will improve my
writing skills. Becoming a better writer makes me better able to communicate.
Whether by text (an important skill to have in the digital world we live in) or
speech.

Is it nice to get a pat on the back when I write something especially good?
Definitely, I can't deny that.

But whether I'm given that pat on the back or not is not going to deter me from
writing because I am mostly intrinsically motivated. And, I don't expect that to
change anytime soon.

This makes me resilient to wayward souls implying that my writing is a waste of
time and effort because few people read it.

Until the big OG in the sky decides to send me deep, deep, deep, deep, into the
ground, I'll be here, writing.

Why?

For the reasons I've expressed above and because it is a fate worse than death
to be trapped inside your own mind, unable to communicate with other people in a
meaningful way.

I know how that feels.

I suffered through that when I was a kid. I had never spoken a word of French in
my entire life and I was thrust into an environment where French was the only
language people spoke. Barely knowing how to properly wipe my own ass, I didn't
have the skills required to deal with the crippling sadness that comes from
being completely isolated.

And so, I will never take for granted the ability to think through ideas and
express them to others.

I will not stop writing no matter what misguided and hurtful things someone
decides to say to me, today, tomorrow or whenever, in an ill-fated attempt to
stop me from enjoying what I obviously enjoy doing.

Even if few people will ever take the time to get to know me or take the time to
read through anything I write.

I can't stop, won't stop, never will stop, no matter what.

Life's short. If you're lucky enough to have free time (which is becoming more
and more of a luxury these days), spend some of that valuable time doing
something that intrinsically motivates you.

It's fun.

And, remember kids, f\*\*\* the haters.
