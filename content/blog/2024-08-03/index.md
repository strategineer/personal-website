I went to Otakuthon, which is Montreal's Japanofile convention, for the first time in 5 years, I'm going to talk about the panels, events and screenings I went to and what I got out of them.

<!--more-->

Seeing people's crazy cosplays, hanging out with friends and eating food in Chinatown is fun and adds to the experience for me BUT panels, shows and screenings are the reason I go to Otakuthon.  

Here's the list of Otakuthon panels, shows and screenings I went to (I've retained the capitalization of the titles as present in the schedule) in no particular order and what I got out of them.

**Panel: What is Truth? Science, Freedom, and Fullmetal Alchemist**

This panel was a disaster. I'd say most panels run by random people with no credentials can be hit or miss. This was a big miss.

Although the panelists had a lot of Charisma, that wasn't enough to make up for the fact that their understanding of how much time they should spend on each slide was comically out of whack.

Getting through 10 out of 40 slides in a 60min feels more like a gag in a sketch comedy skit, not a thing that actually happens in real life.

**Panel: History of Gundam Model Kits**

This panelist knew his shit, he's steeped in the culture of Gundam Model Kits and was well enough informed on the subject to talk about its history at length.

The specifics of the history of Gundam Model Kits was interesting but not very useful to me. It did however kickstart some thinking about the hobby.

Gundam Model Kits are essentially the equivalent of Ikea furniture but for anime figurines. In both cases, you gather all the pieces and follow the detailed step-by-step guide to end up with the final product, either a posable mecha miniature or a bookshelf.

Where these two activities differ is the number of pieces and size of said pieces, a Gundam Model Kit can have hundreds (thousands?) of pieces and they're quite small.

The hobby is also closely related to LEGO of course.

Making something with their hands, even if this amounts to clicking parts of a puzzle together, seems to make people happy and attach some of that joy to the object they've built. And so they buy more.

I don't think it's something I would be much interested in getting into seriously but it might be fun to try once. 

**Event: SHIRAN KEDO - A Wealth of Rakugo Stories From Osaka by Cyril Coppini**

THIS.

Cyril Coppini is a legend --- a Frenchman living in Japan for 27 years who's part of the Japan-France translation-industrial-complex who also performs Rakugo which is a one-man theater / sit-down comedy experience where the performer plays the role of two characters, usually one being dominant over the other.

He's great at it. It was truly a privilege to be able to see his performance, if we lived in a just world he would have filled the entire auditorium but sadly we do not.

I would gladly spend 70$ for an Otakuthon ticket just to see this legend perform again.

**Panel: OTAKUTHON FOOT CHAMP 2024 (16+)**

Feet. Feet. Feet.

Some people love'em, most people have'em, some people really love feet.

Why did I go to this panel?

Well, I appreciate feet like everyone does. I'm glad I have them. They're useful and I respect them. But I'm not a foot fetishist.

The reason I go to panels like this is to get a glimpse at the passion that the panelists or people in the audience have for whatever the panel's about.

I was pleasantly surprised with how well this panel was run and how memorable it was, so much so that I wouldn't be surprised if it was staged.

There was a lot of audience participation in this panel which can be a recipe for disaster but in this case it wasn't.

So, when entering the room the audience was presented with a QR code leading to a Google Forms page with 20 multiple choice questions, each having an image of a foot from an anime, and you having to guess which anime it was from. The 10 people with the best scores on this preliminary quiz were brought to the stage and competed with each other in the main event.

The person who scored the highest on the preliminary quiz was invited to the stage first, his pseudonym "Return of the King" was called out by the host. It wasn't until the host saw Mr. "Return of the King" walking up to the stage that he recognized him and the golden foot trophy he was raising above his head.

This was the man, the legend himself, 2023's OTAKUTHON FOOT CHAMP.

Once all contestants were seated, more anime feet were shown and contestants buzzed in their answers by shouting "FEET!".

Soon enough, my eyes were graced with the image forever seared into my brain of the Feet King, twice crowned, raising his hands into the air grasping onto his two golden foot trophies.

He spoke the following words (I'm paraphrasing here) with a slight French Canadian accent: "Last year, I wasn't interested in feet. But now, everything is different, I enjoy feet now."

A man of few words but a newly found love of feet that will last him a lifetime.

These panelists deserve the world for giving the Feet King a reason to exist and hone his craft.

Their use of a dedicated "FEET" sign that was raised in the air whenever the panelists wanted the crowd to shout "FEET!" repeatedly.

Their decision to periodically throw "Fruit by the Foot" (do you get it?) candy into the crowd was... something else.

The vibes in this room were impecabble. I've become so invested in the Feet King's legacy that I will find a way to show to this panel again if they panelists choose to take time out of their day to make it happen.

**Panel: Is It Hentai Or Is It Anime? (18+)**

Fucking garbage. Seriously these panelists were forced at gunpoint to run this (and 3 other panels apparently). This is the kind of panel that makes people stop showing up to panels.

Atrocious low effort slides from people who clearly weren't taken their jobs seriously.

The entire premise of this panel precluded the existence of an equivalent to the Feet King present in the previous one. At that point, why even show up if the true degenerates are not being given an opportunity to show off their degeneracy to everyone else.

**Panel: Orange Presents: Studio Panel**

An animation

**Screening: Samurai Pizza Cats**

I watched an episode and a half of this before leaving to grab a bite to eat. It seems like a parody of anime, a parody of Saturday morning cartoons, a parody of Super Sentai. The English Dub of this series is it's own thing because at the time in 1991, info on the original Japanese series was low to non-existent so the dubbers came up with a lot of their own material.  

There's a time and a place for something like this. It got a few chuckles out of me which is impressive considering how old it is.

**Screening: Kurayukaba & Kuramerukagari (13+)** AND **Panel: Kurayukaba & Kuramerukagari discussion panel with director Shigeyoshi Tsukahara**

Oooooooh I was hoping for something good and I was pleasantly surprised. This double feature of Kuramerukagari (last year's Fantasia audience award winner) and Kurayukaba, the previous movie made by the same team, was a delight.

Nothing has convinced me more that people who watch anime have severe brain damage than reading through reviews of these two movies on Letterboxd and IMDB. The level of media literacy in the anime enjoyer sphere is distressingly low. I wonder if that's partially due to the audience skewing younger or something like that. But man, it's depressing.

Both of these movies are fun, interesting and beautiful with a lot of cool ideas in them (perhaps a few too many to fit into their 60min runtimes). I would love to see the director Shigeyoshi Tsukahara get the opportunity to take the team he's built and get the funding to make a 90min movie because I think that it would be fantastic.

He's a counter-culture *auteur*, who learned to animate on his own and over the course of two decades has finally been given an opportunity to build a team and make something out of it. I would love to continue to see him able to do this.


...

So.

Will I be going back next year? Probably, although it depends on how sick I get and for how long...
