A list of tips & tricks I've figured out over the course of several months of using Foundry VTT.

- Satellite Imagery for non-DND battlemaps
  - If engagements happen hundreds of grid squares away with guns of all sorts, tiny DND-esque battlemaps won't do whatever theming is
  - If you're playing a modern or something modern-like if you squint (like Palladium's Rifts) then using Google Earth Pro, exporting images at a common zoom level (I've found 100m to be perfect) allows for quickly generating at scale battlemaps with realistic terrain and the tactical options they provide
  - Sat Maps give also give a distinctive Tier 1 operator vibe if that's what you're looking for  
- Modules
  - Quick Insert - Search Widget
    - Hitting control + space bar and getting access to everything in your game (characters, items, NPCs, everything!) and being able to drag and drop wherever you need it as a GM when you're running the game and as a player when you're buying equipment, etc. 
  - Dice Tray
    - Dice Tray makes it as easy as possible for you and your players to roll dice with a sleek UI with good UX instead of typing the roll out. 
  - Token Action HUD Core
    - Foundry without Token Action HUD Core is great but a shell of what it can be. If the system you're playing with supports Token Action HUD Core you have to use it!
    - It puts a bar of actions at the top of your screen when you select a PC or NPC token and gives you quick access to all of the relevant stat rolls, ability checks, etc. tied to that character. This speeds up combat tremendously because the process of figuring how many dice to roll and what kind of action player wants to take has been boiled down to picking an option from a menu and clicking it. I imagine that this is a must-have for running crunchier games. 
  - Tokenizer
    -
  - Image Hover
    - Simple but great, hovering over a token shows the underlying full art associated to it which helps with setting the scenes.
  - Item Piles
    - Being able to drop items onto the map seems like it should be a core feature (but it isn't) --- The Item Piles module implements exactly this.
  - Drag Ruler (until it's fully implemented in the Foundry core)
  - Token Tooltip Alt
