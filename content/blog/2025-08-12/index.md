According to their website, Otakuthon is:

> a bilingual annual convention for all ages, celebrating anime, manga, games, Japanese culture and its community.

It's based in Montreal and has been happening for the past 20 years or so. I've attended half a dozen times since sometime around the mid-2015s (with a break during 2020 and the years that followed).

I attended the most recent Otakuthon over the weekend and had a blast. I attended as many interesting looking panels as I could and I took notes for all of them.

In this post, I will share some things I learned, some quotes and some thoughts. I'll share any social media links for the listed panelists (I apologize if I get someone's name/links wrong, I'm trying my best!) and, in some cases, watch presentations that they've recorded on posted on their channels.

I didn't take extensive notes for the first three panels I went to so I apologize in advance for them being pretty light.


# Day 1

## Blatant Copyright Infringement in Anime

Panelist: Jesse Betteridge ([bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/jbetteridge.bsky.social), [podcast](http://www.zannen.ca/))

It was informational, nuanced and hearing blatant copyright infring-ing music back to back was a lot of fun.

All songs are inspired by other songs that the composer has listened prior to composing them... And then there's Yoko Kanno.

## What is Manga Lettering?

Panelist: Chris Burgener ([bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/fog.mediocrity.ca))

It was interesting to learn about a job in the manga industry that I didn't know existed.

## The Food of Delicious in Dungeon (Episodes 1-4)

Panelist: Mich Chan ([bsky](https://togarashimayo.com/))

The food looked good.

## Intro to Japanese Underground Culture

Panelist: Clara of Anguara Research Center ([blog](https://anguraresearchcenter.wordpress.com/))

This was the first undeniably fantastic presentation of the con for me.

Someone extremely passionate about a topic, in this case Angura an "underground" japanese theater and art movement, talking about it was informative and interesting. 

I started taking notes for this panel and I'm glad I did because I was able to write down quotes as I heard them.

The history of Angura begins in post-WW2 Japan as a rejection of the mainstream theater of the time, shingeki.

It's weird. What's interesting to me about Angura is its focus on blending of fictional and non-fictional elements into one. Breaking the 4th wall and audience participation is a key component of the Angura movement.

## The Geek Show

Panelists: Guillaume Pelletier, Andy St-Louis, Anthony Remillard, Marie-Helene Racine Lacroix, Thomas Croft, Francis Legendre

I had no clue what this was going to be going into it. It turned out to be a "geek"-themed standup comedy show.

Guillaume Pelletier MCed the whole shebang. All the comedians came prepared to make people laugh and they mostly succeeded.

The highlight of the show was Thomas Croft, who showed up on stage in full Waluigi cosplay and nailed joke after joke after joke. Impressions, slides-based-jokes, puns, he was hitting everything.

The other comedians were great, Thomas Croft was amazing.

## The Power of Love - Weaponized Sexuality in Japanese Media

Panelist: Mathew Poulter ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@theovermatt))

Mathew Poulter is a PhD student who came to talk about "Weaponized Sexuality in Japanese Media".

He went back through time all the way back to Cutie Honey (1973), pointing to it as being the first anime to use sex appeal of its main character as the big draw for the show (the repercussions of this are still being felt to this day, leading us and Mathew Poulter himself to describe anime as being "relentlessly horny").

Poulter then brings up Sailor Moon, Kill la Kill and a more recent anime named Keijo!!!!!!!!! (Yes, that's 8 exclamation marks).

I haven't seen Cutie Honey but Sailor Moon was constantly playing when I was kid and back when I watched Kill la Kill many years ago I thought it was.

So I decided to watch Keijo. I had seen this anime advertised back in 2016 but I dismissed as being pure horny trash. Who could blame me? The premise of a full contact sport where women use their boobs and breasts to slam their opponents off of floating platforms and into the water is completely egregious.

I was extremely wrong about it though. Keijo is absolutely horny but to such an extent that it surpasses my human ability to be horny.

The show is so absurd, it feels as though the show's intent is to parody rather than fully 100% earnestly engage with the horniest. It's not not horny but the horniest is far from being the main appeal of the show, for me at least.

What makes it so good? Well, in short, it's a comedy, sports and shonen anime condensed into a tight single 12 episode season, filled with gags, puns and jokes all throughout that never stop being funny until the very end of the show.

It's not a perfect show. There's a few fat phobic jokes that feel out of place considering how the character designs and the rest of the script feels mostly body positive and accepting. Also, there's enough non-concensual (and to be fair, a lot of concensual) groping in the show which might be uncomfortable for some people.

But despite this quibbles I have with the show, it is one the best shows I've watched full stop. I've never laughed more frequently or harder watching an anime.

## What Lies Beyond Great Visual Novels

Panelist: Bassman ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@bassman.reviews)), Bhromor Rahman ([twitter](https://x.com/brosbrawls))

The Best Visual Novels?

I've enjoyed a few visual novels in my day including most of the games in the Zero Escape series by Kotaro Uchikoshi as well as the first Danganronpa by Kazutaka Kodaka (so you can imagine that I've been keeping my eye on [The Hundred Line: Last Defense](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/) where these two madmen have joined forces).

But I haven't played one in quite a while despite very wanting too (I own at least 3 visual novels that I haven't even booted up once).

This panel was hosted by two people: Bassman, a VN-head making videos mostly about the SciAdv series of visual novels, and Bhromor Rahman, a freelance journalist and law graduate.

The first thing that struck me about this panel was Bassman look. I've never heard and seen someone and immediately thought to myself "yes, this is an intellectually-refined man of culture if I've ever seen one".

Glasses, buttoned up shirt, dress shoes. I don't know if it was cosplay or all I know is that it was really good and appropriate considering the topic at hand.

The panel consisted of the two hosts going back and forth talking about their favourite visual novels grouped in various genres. Bhromor Rahman mostly covered the horny VNs and Bassman talked about the less horny ones.

My big takeaway from the panel, other than a gigantic list of VNs that I'm interested in, was that I really should play through the SciAdv series of visual novels.

If you're not familiar with [SciAdv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Adventure) (I wasn't until very recently), it's a series of 6 visual novels with the 2nd one being Steins;Gate which

Now, I've been going to Otakuthon for many years and I've only cosplayed twice. Once I wore a boxer's outfit who appears for a few seconds in *Himouto! Umaru-chan* (I'm not sure it holds up but I remember it being very wholesome). The year before that I had worn a lab coat, dress pants and a black belt, very low effort, cosplaying as the main character from Steins;Gate.

For a long time, I had claimed that my favorite anime was Steins;Gate (nowadays I would say Re:Creators or probably Keijo!!!!!!!!!) but here I am having never played the visual novel.

I've wanted to but I never have.

My commitment to myself is that I'll play the first game in the Science Adventure (SciAdv) series this year and if I like it I'll also play the sequel.

The series is vast and has a large enough, and passionate enough, community that all the game's in the series are well supported with community patches to update and any parts of the official translation and graphics so I'm in good hands.


Minor spoilers for the first few hours of play of CHAOS;HEAD NOAH, the first game in the SciAdv series:
{{< spoiler >}}
After just a few hours of play, I'm blown away by CHAOS;HEAD NOAH narrative. None of what I tend dislike about anime and visual novels is present in the game (so far).

The main character is not a blank slate player stand-in. He's absolutely a character and as a player we see the whole world of the game through his skewed point of view.

The game seemed to be interested in exploring similar ideas to Serial Experiments Lain and I'm into that because Lain is awesome.

All of the erotic or gory scenes (framed as delusions that the MC is experiencing, possibly forced onto him by God and/or the player) are optional and completely left to the player to engage in or not. So, you as the player can choose what kind of scenes you'd like to see based on the context. You're never sure what you're going to get but you made a choice and thus are partially to blame for whatever you end up seeing. The blurring of the lines between the real and the fictional (and the meta-fictional) is constant throughout the VN so far and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

## I can't BELIEVE It's Not Hentai

Panelist: Bhromor Rahman ([twitter](https://x.com/brosbrawls))

I got pulled into this one by some friends, I swear.

A primer on the world of "ecci" anime with various examples quickly shown to give the audience a taste of what's out there.

In practice, I'm not interested in softcore pornography anime BUT I do appreciate the honesty and that some of works bring to the table.

As stated earlier, modern anime is "relentlessly horny" and so it's a surprise to me that there's all sorts of horny anime out there.

What I hate to see is shonen anime targeted at young boys (although the lines have been blurred and at least in the West, shonen anime is watched by many adults and sometimes can be fantastic like in the case of Keijo) which almost always contains horny scenes AF sexualizing underage women.

This is disgusting. I have much less of a problem with anime being horny if the characters aren't children and the anime is explicitly billed as being horny.

A minor caveat to this is that horniess is so prevalent in anime, visual novels, JRPGs, etc. that's it basically impossible to avoid. And, you will be eventually forced to look past it to enjoy the rest of what the media object's got to offer.

I left this panel halfway through to go home and commune with God. Right before I left though, a screenshot from an anime where {{< spoiler >}}a dog, who's actually a human man/boy transformed, is implied to be licking his woman/girl owner, you know where{{< /spoiler >}}.
