According to their website, Otakuthon is:

> a bilingual annual convention for all ages, celebrating anime, manga, games, Japanese culture and its community.

It's based in Montreal and has been happening for the past 20 years or so. I've attended half a dozen times since sometime around the mid-2015s (with a break during 2020 and the years that followed).

I attended the most recent Otakuthon over the weekend and had a blast. I attended as many interesting looking panels as I could and I took notes for all of them.

In this post, I will share some things I learned, some quotes and some thoughts. I'll share any social media links for the listed panelists (I apologize if I get someone's name/links wrong, I'm trying my best!) and, in some cases, watch presentations that they've recorded on posted on their channels.

I didn't take extensive notes for the first three panels I went to so I apologize in advance for them being pretty light.


# Day 1

## Blatant Copyright Infringement in Anime

Panelist: Jesse Betteridge ([bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/jbetteridge.bsky.social), [podcast](http://www.zannen.ca/))

It was informational, nuanced and hearing blatant copyright infring-ing music back to back was a lot of fun.

All songs are inspired by other songs that the composer has listened prior to composing them... And then there's Yoko Kanno.

## What is Manga Lettering?

Panelist: Chris Burgener ([bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/fog.mediocrity.ca))

It was interesting to learn about a job in the manga industry that I didn't know existed.

## The Food of Delicious in Dungeon (Episodes 1-4)

Panelist: Mich Chan ([bsky](https://togarashimayo.com/))

The food looked good.

## Intro to Japanese Underground Culture

Panelist: Clara of Anguara Research Center ([blog](https://anguraresearchcenter.wordpress.com/))

This was the first undeniably fantastic presentation of the con for me.

Someone extremely passionate about a topic, in this case Angura an "underground" japanese theater and art movement, talking about it was informative and interesting. 

I started taking notes for this panel and I'm glad I did because I was able to write down quotes as I heard them.

The history of Angura begins in post-WW2 Japan as a rejection of the mainstream theater of the time, shingeki.

It's weird. What's interesting to me about Angura is its focus on blending of fictional and non-fictional elements into one. Breaking the 4th wall and audience participation is a key component of the Angura movement.

## The Geek Show

Panelists: Guillaume Pelletier, Andy St-Louis, Anthony Remillard, Marie-Helene Racine Lacroix, Thomas Croft, Francis Legendre

I had no clue what this was going to be going into it. It turned out to be a "geek"-themed standup comedy show.

Guillaume Pelletier MCed the whole shebang. All the comedians came prepared to make people laugh and they mostly succeeded.

The highlight of the show was Thomas Croft, who showed up on stage in full Waluigi cosplay and nailed joke after joke after joke. Impressions, slides-based-jokes, puns, he was hitting everything.

The other comedians were great, Thomas Croft was amazing.

## The Power of Love - Weaponized Sexuality in Japanese Media

Panelist: Mathew Poulter ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@theovermatt))

Mathew Poulter is a PhD student who came to talk about "Weaponized Sexuality in Japanese Media".

He went back through time all the way back to Cutie Honey (1973), pointing to it as being the first anime to use sex appeal of its main character as the big draw for the show (the repercussions of this are still being felt to this day, leading us and Mathew Poulter himself to describe anime as being "relentlessly horny").

Poulter then brings up Sailor Moon, Kill la Kill and a more recent anime named Keijo!!!!!!!!! (Yes, that's 8 exclamation marks).

I haven't seen Cutie Honey but Sailor Moon was constantly playing when I was kid and back when I watched Kill la Kill many years ago I thought it was.

So I decided to watch Keijo. I had seen this anime advertised back in 2016 but I dismissed as being pure horny trash. Who could blame me? The premise of a full contact sport where women use their boobs and breasts to slam their opponents off of floating platforms and into the water is completely egregious.

I was extremely wrong about it though. Keijo is absolutely horny but to such an extent that it surpasses my human ability to be horny.

The show is so absurd, it feels as though the show's intent is to parody rather than fully 100% earnestly engage with the horniest. It's not not horny but the horniest is far from being the main appeal of the show, for me at least.

What makes it so good? Well, in short, it's a comedy, sports and shonen anime condensed into a tight single 12 episode season, filled with gags, puns and jokes all throughout that never stop being funny until the very end of the show.

It's not a perfect show. There's a few fat phobic jokes that feel out of place considering how the character designs and the rest of the script feels mostly body positive and accepting. Also, there's enough non-concensual (and to be fair, a lot of concensual) groping in the show which might be uncomfortable for some people.

But despite this quibbles I have with the show, it is one the best shows I've watched full stop. I've never laughed more frequently or harder watching an anime.

## What Lies Beyond Great Visual Novels

Panelist: Bassman ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@bassman.reviews)), Bhromor Rahman ([twitter](https://x.com/brosbrawls))

The Best Visual Novels?

I've enjoyed a few visual novels in my day including most of the games in the Zero Escape series by Kotaro Uchikoshi as well as the first Danganronpa by Kazutaka Kodaka (so you can imagine that I've been keeping my eye on [The Hundred Line: Last Defense](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/) where these two madmen have joined forces).

But I haven't played one in quite a while despite very wanting too (I own at least 3 visual novels that I haven't even booted up once).

This panel was hosted by two people: Bassman, a VN-head making videos mostly about the SciAdv series of visual novels, and Bhromor Rahman, a freelance journalist and law graduate.

The first thing that struck me about this panel was Bassman look. I've never heard and seen someone and immediately thought to myself "yes, this is an intellectually-refined man of culture if I've ever seen one".

Glasses, buttoned up shirt, dress shoes. I don't know if it was cosplay or all I know is that it was really good and appropriate considering the topic at hand.

The panel consisted of the two hosts going back and forth talking about their favourite visual novels grouped in various genres. Bhromor Rahman mostly covered the horny VNs and Bassman talked about the less horny ones.

My big takeaway from the panel, other than a gigantic list of VNs that I'm interested in, was that I really should play through the SciAdv series of visual novels.

If you're not familiar with [SciAdv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Adventure) (I wasn't until very recently), it's a series of 6 visual novels with the 2nd one being Steins;Gate which

Now, I've been going to Otakuthon for many years and I've only cosplayed twice. Once I wore a boxer's outfit who appears for a few seconds in *Himouto! Umaru-chan* (I'm not sure it holds up but I remember it being very wholesome). The year before that I had worn a lab coat, dress pants and a black belt, very low effort, cosplaying as the main character from Steins;Gate.

For a long time, I had claimed that my favorite anime was Steins;Gate (nowadays I would say Re:Creators or probably Keijo!!!!!!!!!) but here I am having never played the visual novel.

I've wanted to but I never have.

My commitment to myself is that I'll play the first game in the Science Adventure (SciAdv) series this year and if I like it I'll also play the sequel.

The series is vast and has a large enough, and passionate enough, community that all the game's in the series are well supported with community patches to update and any parts of the official translation and graphics so I'm in good hands.


Minor spoilers for the first few hours of play of CHAOS;HEAD NOAH, the first game in the SciAdv series:
{{< spoiler >}}
After just a few hours of play, I'm blown away by CHAOS;HEAD NOAH narrative. None of what I tend dislike about anime and visual novels is present in the game (so far).

The main character is not a blank slate player stand-in. He's absolutely a character and as a player we see the whole world of the game through his skewed point of view.

The game seemed to be interested in exploring similar ideas to Serial Experiments Lain and I'm into that because Lain is awesome.

All of the erotic or gory scenes (framed as delusions that the MC is experiencing, possibly forced onto him by God and/or the player) are optional and completely left to the player to engage in or not. So, you as the player can choose what kind of scenes you'd like to see based on the context. You're never sure what you're going to get but you made a choice and thus are partially to blame for whatever you end up seeing. The blurring of the lines between the real and the fictional (and the meta-fictional) is constant throughout the VN so far and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

## I can't BELIEVE It's Not Hentai

Panelist: Bhromor Rahman ([twitter](https://x.com/brosbrawls))

I got pulled into this one by some friends, I swear.

A primer on the world of "ecci" anime with various examples quickly shown to give the audience a taste of what's out there.

In practice, I'm not interested in softcore pornography anime BUT I do appreciate the honesty and that some of works bring to the table.

As stated earlier, modern anime is "relentlessly horny" and so it's a surprise to me that there's all sorts of horny anime out there.

What I hate to see is shonen anime targeted at young boys (although the lines have been blurred and at least in the West, shonen anime is watched by many adults and sometimes can be fantastic like in the case of Keijo) which almost always contains horny scenes AF sexualizing underage women.

This is disgusting. I have much less of a problem with anime being horny if the characters aren't children and the anime is explicitly billed as being horny.

A minor caveat to this is that horniess is so prevalent in anime, visual novels, JRPGs, etc. that's it basically impossible to avoid. And, you will be eventually forced to look past it to enjoy the rest of what the media object's got to offer.

I left this panel halfway through to go home and commune with God. Right before I left though, a screenshot from an anime where {{< spoiler >}}a dog, who's actually a human man/boy transformed, is implied to be licking his woman/girl owner, you know where{{< /spoiler >}}.

# Day 2


## The History of Television in Japan

Panelist: Jesse Betteridge ([bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/jbetteridge.bsky.social), [podcast](http://www.zannen.ca/))

Follow this man, listen to his podcast! Great voice, great presentation, love it

This panel was dense with info on TV in Japan. From its inception, to its spread from rich households to all households through the intermediary of pro wrestling.

In post-WW2 era Japan, large groups of people would crowd around small TVs outdoors to watch asian pro-wrestlers (the most popular of them, Mitsuhiro Momota, was actually Korean) wrestle "american" wrestlers (often Canadian). This kind of narrative proved popular at the time due to the american occupation of Japan.

---

In the mid-90s the anime industry was in a bit of slump, Neon Genesis Evangelion, directed by Hideaki Anno, most likely is responsible for ending that slump due to its massive popularity in Japan and in the rest of the world.

---

In Persona 4, the imagery of TV sets stacked on top of one another was inspired by the actual stacks of TV sets found in Japan when they switched over from analog signals to digital signals.

---

The [Asama-Sansō incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asama-Sans%C5%8D_incident) AKA the Wrecking Ball Operation.

---

And a bunch more stuff but that's all I got for now.

## "i hire hitman on u" - What doesn't make sense about toxic behavior in online games?

Panelist: Thomas Burelli ([cv](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-law/common-law/centre-environmental-law-global-sustainability/people/thomas-burelli))

> title translated from French: "i hire hitman on u" - Qu'est-ce qui ne tourne pas rond avec la toxicité dans les jeux en ligne?

Thomas Burelli Professor of Law at University of Ottawa with one of his PhD students (I didn't catch his name) presented two amazing panels at Otakuthon. This one focused on toxic behavior in online games.

---

Apparently, you can't defend yourself in court for making death threats by saying "it's just a joke bro", at least in Quebec. By definition, a death threat cannot be a joke. There's no such thing.

---

According to the data provided to Thomas Burelli's team by the EU, there were no instances of sex-based discrimination in League of Legends in the year that they requested the data for.

Huh? Anyone's who's played LoL knows that there's no way that this is actually true. But that's the data reported to the EU by Riot Games so, either they're lying or there is something seriously wrong with the way they're reporting their data.

---

It's easier to get banned by leaving a game of League of Legends early than it is to get banned by repeatedly making death threats through text and voice chat. Leaving games is detected and punished through automated means but that doesn't seem to be the case for death threats.

This doesn't seem right considering that death threats (in North America and the EU at least) are criminal offenses whereas leaving games early definitely are not. So. there's obviously a big disconnect between how the law as written and how it's enforced, or not in this case, 

---

A great part of both of Thomas Burelli panels was the concrete steps he presented to the audience of actions they could take to help make the situation better. It's well and good to present a problem but providing some next steps is even better.

For this panel, the easiest thing to do was to request your data from the online games that you every 3 months. Because legally, at least in Quebec and the EU, they're obligated to allow you to see this data and modify it if it's wrong (for example, if you've been reported for making death threats but you actually haven't).

## Directing JRPG with Katelyn Gault

Panelist: Katelyn Gault ([imdb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3072277/))

Although I'm not planning on becoming a professional voice actor or director anytime soon I'm glad I showed up anyway. But I'm always trying to get better at doing voices for my tabletop roleplaying sessions and I could see myself eventually needing to direct a voice actor for a video game project of mine.  

Thankfully, Katelyn Gault's panel was a fantastic overview of her work as both a voice actor and director and how she does it.

---

"As an actor, you're always interviewing for a job."

As a voice actor you're constantly looking for work, the likelihood of landing a job is really low and so Gault recommends that you prep as you need for an audition and then once it's done don't think about it ever again.

I'm not a voice actor and I'm not planning to be but I often find myself interviewing for jobs and I'm going to be trying to put this recommendation into practice myself. To keep myself sane during the interview processes.

TODO

---

Gault described what 1st sessions with a voice actor usually look like for her:

- The director, the actor, the sound engineer (the unsung heroes of the voice recording world) and maybe a writer listen to the voice actor's audition
- The writer, if present, and the director would give the voice actor an initial round of feedback.
- The actor is give the chance to ask questions to the director and the writer. Gault says that this is a very important part of the collaborative process. The actor is expected to bring something to the table more than just their performance.
- Recordings are broken down into sessions based on the kind of voice work that's going to be done. For example, voice actors can do JRPG-style battle voice work for about 1h30min so that should be accounted for in the planning. 
- Each line is recorded with at least 3 takes (A, B, C) and they choose the best one.
  - If the voice actor is recording without any other actors present, which is often the case, the director should read everyone else's line to bring the voice actor into the scene.
  - Each line is recorded to picture (tied to a cutscene), timed (tied to an animation) or dry (completely freeform like in visual novel dialogs).

---

A voice director primarily acts as a liaison between the client (usually a game/animation studio) and the actors. The casting is usually done by someone else. It's both a creative and managerial position that is often done freelance.

Ideally, the voice director should be in a position to provide the voice actor with all the context they need so that they can deliver the best performance for the role. To do so, the client needs to provide the voice director with the context they'll need to pass on to the voice actors they'll be directing.

---

According to Gault, a good voice director is going to be looking for the following from a voice actor:

- Clean solid diction/enunciation/elocution
- Proper vocal technique, breath support and stamina (vocally trained singers have a big advantage here)
- The ability to take direction and iterate
- Offers ideas for the performance (open to collaboration)
- Believability (no matter how ridiculous lines are, the voice actor has to convince everyone else with their performance that they believe)
- Strong choices

---

Asking yourself "What are the stakes of the scene?" before giving the line is key. Are you picking up milk from the grocery store to go with your cookies back home or to save little kitty or, better yet, the world?

---

"I'm always going to be anxious, I'm an actor."

This was interesting to hear in context with what Gault's mentor, her words not mine, Tony Oliver said in his panel.

According to Oliver, at its core acting requires the actor to feel what the character is feeling emotionally and the rest of the performance will from that.

---

Awesome panel!


## Hell Teacher Jigoku Sensei Nube talk with Ryōtarō Okiayu

Panelist: Ryōtarō Okiayu ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dtar%C5%8D_Okiayu)) with interpreter, REMOW Co. Ltd. Representative

This panel was not good. But being able to sit just a few feet away from a professional japanese voice actor, especially one as experienced as Ryōtarō Okiayu, performing a live-dubbing of a scene from an anime he's in was insane.

The voice coming out of his body was unreal. I've heard performances like this through my speakers time and time again but it was really impressive being physically present for one.

---

One interesting thing about this presentation was that they had prizes to give away to people in the audience. Because there were fewer prizes to give out than people in the audience, they had to choose people to give the prizes too. So, they did so through a quiz with the simplest questions you can imagine.

In the moment, I couldn't comprehend why they would choose to do this with a quiz. The vibe was off.

And then I remembered that in Quebec, it's illegal to have a lottery of any kind without involving [Loto-Québec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loto-Qu%C3%A9bec), a branch of the provincial government that oversees any and all gambling that occurs in the province. So they could get in trouble if the panelist gave out the prizes randomly.

---

As we'll see later, the two REMOW presentations I went to, one willingly one semi-willingly, were unmitigated disasters although I still to get something out of them. 

## Ken Arto - A journey through japanimation

title translated from French: Ken Arto - Un parcours dans la japanimation

Panelist: Ken Arto ([imdb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4632702/))

There's likely very few people in the world better suited for revealing how the Japanese animation industry actually works to a French-speaking audience than Ken Arto, a French-Japanese animator who's been working in Japan for over a decade.

Ken Arto was soft-spoken and humble but also clearly extremely talented.

A combination of his French mannerisms and some nervousness led him to repeat "du coup" (roughly translated as "therefore" but used as a filler word) constantly which was endearing.

---

Arto contrasted the French style of visual arts education with the Japanese one. In France, you spend many years learning how to draw and animate in school entering the workforce fully capable of doing the job whereas in Japan, you learn to draw and animate on the job for the most part.  

---

In terms of the economics of the work, in the mid 2010s he started his career making a fixed salary of 400€ per month and about 2€ to 3€ per drawing. Every month, he'd be able to produce something like 300 drawings which was the expectation at the time and so in total he'd make around 1000€ per month.

Most animation studios being located in a certain part of Tokyo, this wouldn't have been enough money to live and so most animators getting into the industry are forced to either live with their parents, commute long distances or draw extremely quickly and work longer hours than they should be, if they're able.

After several years in the industry, Arto's monthly pay increased to something around 3000€ per month which is fine and livable but great.

The Japanese animation industry seems to be trending towards better pay for their animators but the crunch culture and generally high and overzealous expectations put on animators hasn't changed much.

And so, the biggest problem with this culture is that it leaves the more experienced animators with less time to mentor the younger ones, and in doing pass on the knowledge they've gained over the course of their long careers in a way that keeps the industry healthy and always improving.

In many ways, the Japanese animation industry seems to have much in common with the global video industry. One that uses and abuses its most passionate workers. Leaving them with no choice but to leave the industry to do literally anything else. Replacing them with a revolving door of juniors who don't know what they're doing and without anyone to mentor them.

If we don't learn from the past, we're destined to repeat it in a never-ending cycle of mediocrity.

---

Video games with anime-style cutscenes pay much more than anime shows. This makes a lot of sense considering the economics of the situation, weebs are willing to pay 60€ for a JRPG but the same is not the case for a anime these days.

---

Arto ended his panel talking about the brain drain that's been happening in the industry for the past few decades. If you take the number of animators working in Japan right now, around 6000, and divide that by the number of animation projects happen at any given time in Japan, around 400, you get 15 animators per projects.

Considering how labour-intensive anime is to produce, there aren't enough Japanese animators to work on all of these projects that the market is funding.

And so, this results in more pressure being applied on the fewer and fewer animators working. Leaving the more experienced of them less time to train new animators to potentially stop this problem from continuing. 


## Directing Anime - A Nuts and Bolts Panel

Panelist: Tony Oliver ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Oliver))

Tony Oliver is a voice actor and director who's presence on the stage was impressive. Within just a few minutes of the presentation, I had an overwhelming sense of him being the most interesting people in the room, potentially one of the most interesting people at the con.

---

Oliver's tips on solving vocal drift:

1. A vocal reference (record yourself doing a voice then listen to it again if you want to reproduce).
2. Physicality. Position your body and vocal chords in the same way to reproduce the same voice.
3. Come up with and repeat a specific phrase that'll get you back back into the voice.

---

According to Oliver, the hardest part of being a voice actor is quieting the voice inside your head that tells you, you suck,

This seems to be an issue that a lot of creatives face. Never feeling like they're work is good enough. When one of the most influential writers of the 20th century repeatedly [states how is work just isn't that good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNxzQSheCkc) compared to other writers, it's pretty clear that no matter how good you are at what you do, there's a part of you that'll always strive for more.

---

## Open Q&A with Coda

Panelist: Coda ([french wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazus%C5%8D_Oda)) with interpreter

My main takeaway from this panel was the idea that we should just let artists make their art instead of forcing them to be parasocial with us.

Although some of the questions were interesting and resulted in interesting responses, many questions were fishing for the artist to validate the question asker's opinion instead of interesting answers.

---

Asking people walking up to the mike to say their name before asking their question is great because it allows the question asker to test the mike and adjust themselves physically before asking their question increasing the chances of their question being heard and understood by the crowd and the panelists.

NB: If you're fielding questions from an audience without microphones, it is critical to restate the question with a mike so that everyone in the room hears both the question and the answer to it. 

I'll definitely keep this in mind if I ever run a panel.

## Magnificent Transformations and Oceans of Sparkles: Maho Shojo & Queerness

Panelist: Pluie d'Astéroïdes ([instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pluiedasteroides/))

One of the only panels that was able to get me to viscerally feel something. A lot of panels at this year's Otakuthon were interesting but none have been emotionally resonant in a positive way.

Watching some of the transformation clips from Maho Shojo (magical girl) anime really hit me in a way that I wasn't expecting.

There's two reasons I can see for this:

1. I watched a bunch of Sailor Moon as a kid and watching these transformation animations brought me back to that time and place.
2. Because these transformation sequences are usually meant to be re-used in more than one episode, the animation studios have an incentive to make them look and sound as good as possible.So, that's what they try to do.

> NB: The Sailor Moon dub was produced in Canada and played in a timeslot when Canadian kids would actually be likely to watch it. And, that explains why so many Canadians of my generation grew up watching the anime and most Americans did not. 

I haven't watched much Maho Shojo anime other than Sailor Moon.

Except for Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Like most of the anime I like, Puella Magi Madoka Magica is clearly an anime made by people who are aware of what Maho Shojo anime tends to be like and are looking to tell a story that thinks critically about what it would actually be like if we relied on young, innocent until they're not, girls to bear the weight of saving the world all the while dealing with the young girlhood.

This extremely fantastical situation doesn't happen in reality but it serves to mimic what it often feels like for kids to grow up in traumatic environments with piles of expectations thrust onto them from all corners.

It's good.

I would love to watch more Maho Shojo anime but Puella Magi Madoka Magica seems more like an exception rather than a rule in terms of quality.

## Shinto in Anime

This panel was by far the worst I attended all weekend.

The slides were poorly put together. The worst offender of this was a single slide showing 15 thousand years of Shinto history.

The panelist didn't seem like were interested in what they were presenting. That's OK. It would be extremely hypocritical for me to point a finger at someone who's not emoting "enough".

Giving a good presentation involves knowing and catering to your audience and I don't believe that the panelist did this.

Now, I've sat through worse presentations in my life.

What sent me over the edge with this panel was the Orientalist perspective.

Now, I'm not saying that a white person can't be into Shintoism and communicate that passion in a panel at a weeb convention. But if a white person would, hypothetically speaking, do such a thing then I would expect them to be aware of themselves being a white person talking about something that culturally does not belong to them, and thus at least giving it the respect it deserves.

Of course, I would rather have someone who has spent significant time of their lives embedding themselves within Japanese culture to speak on the subject their passionate about or, even better yet, a Japanese person.

For example, people like Ken Arto who spoke about Japanese animation at this year's Otakuthon or Cyril Coppini who performed [Rakugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakugo) at last year's Otakuthon.

But, sometimes the best you've got is a white person who went to Japan one time. And that's OK as long as this particular white person is self-aware of themselves as an outsider and respectful of the culture they are talking about. That was definitely not the case in this panel.

So, please for the love of (the) god(s), if you are a white person looking to speak on cultural matters outside of your own lived experience then please listen to [the Asians Represent Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@aznsrepresent/videos) and read [Orientalism by Edward Said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book)) before presenting something to hundreds of people at a convention.

Of course, the fault here also lies with organizers of Otakuthon who greenlit this panel and most definitely shouldn't have.

We can do better.
