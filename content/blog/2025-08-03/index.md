All TODOs are for adding personal info. Ask first!

In this post, I'll briefly describe Sleepaway, a TTRPG designed by Jay Dragon, then I'll cover my story game "credentials" (or lack thereof) and then I'll conclude with some thoughts on the oneshot I played in recently.

Sleepaway is a horror TTRPG where players each play a camp counselor in a camp of their own creation suffering from the evil and chaotic influence of the Lindworm (like The Thing but more lovecraftian).

Sleepaway is a GMless TTRPG and so players are encouraged to "pick up" setting elements at appropriate times, stuff like "The Field at the Center of the Camp" or "The Campers", and bring these parts of the camp to life in a collaborative way.

My experience with story game TTRPGs is relatively light. I've played a few sessions of {{< book_url "9781633442801" >}} almost a decade ago. I read the rules for {{< book_url "apocalypse_world_2e" >}} and {{< book_url "the_annotated_sorcerer" >}}. I've ran a dozen sessions of {{< book_url "9781613171325" >}} and I've played in a few dozen more (but it's been awhile).

I'm always looking to improve my roleplaying skills and so when I was given the chance to play in a kind of TTRPG that I don't have a lot of experience with, I jumped at the opportunity.

I chose to play The Athlete, because I felt like my inexperience with this kind of TTRPG would be a good fit for a character who's suppressing their emotions, walking away from social conflict to punch something up until the pressure overflows into outbursts of anger and frustration. 

I prepped for the session by reading through the rulebook and filling out the  


So how did this session of Sleepaway go?

Great! I would love to bring a game like this to my table with players who have expressed an interest in doing more collaborative storytelling and roleplaying.

# The Less Good

## Time (or lack of it)

The session was 3 hours long and this included the character creation process, the camp creation process and the oneshot.

If I were to play this again I would fight for a 4 hour at least because the oneshot encourages you to end on a concluding scene where everything is fucked and there's no coming back from "uncomfortable and tragic positions" that the councilors find themselves in. 

The oneshot was around 1h30min and I felt like that didn't give us enough time to introduce the characters and the camp we'd created and ramp up to its eventual collapse by the end of the session.

I thought that it would be cool to end on this kind of BIG climax. At the end of the session, another player expressed that they liked the first part of the session, before steered it into hardcore horror (through my roles as both Lindworm "seer" and the Underhill King).

To help with this, next time, I would ask the table to agree on what kind of intensity/genre of horror we're interested in roleplaying and where we're hoping we'll end up by the end of the oneshot.

Is this a mystery that ends with the flaying of an animal or is this a slasher that ends with the last camp councilor holding onto a bloody knife, hiding in a closet? We'd then use the answer to this as a guiding hand to help us collaborate on building up to the conclusion of the oneshot that we feel is appropriate within the allotted time.

## My Roleplaying

I never end a roleplaying session feeling like I've run or played it perfectly. I always try my best, I'm always looking to improve what my best is, and compassionately critiquing my own play is part of that. So let's have at it.

The one rule of improv is "Yes, and". Basically, you should accept the ideas that are presented by others at the table and build on them constructively. The "Yes" part of this is easy but the "and" part, not so much at least for me.

Specifically, when speaking as a character to another character I sometimes find myself at a loss and falling short of my own expectations.

I need to catch myself in these moments and responding in-character in a way that makes sense and builds on what the other player has said. Relating to this, I'm proud of one moment during the session where I realized that I hadn't given enough for the other player to bounce off of when I was speaking in character and so I added some more meat onto my response for them to respond to.

Also, when I killing my character Burt off (cool!), he didn't say anything... That was a big missed opportunity there, screaming "FUCK YOU!" straight at the skull of this evil Horned God (a manifestation of the Underhill King?) would have been great and would have fit Burt's character perfectly. It happens, whatever. We'll do better next time.

An even greater sin, was that the Horned God, as he was slicing Burt in half, also didn't say anything. Uhhhhhh.

What an absolute shame. A simple "FUCK YOU!" by Burt followed by a "SEE YOU IN HELL!" by the Underhill King would have been SO MUCH BETTER. Also, this would have been a great mirror to the conflict between Burt and Sam described below.

This is a recurring issue I have where I already have a hard enough time coming up with full sentences that my characters should say, playing both characters at once and setting up this climax was a bit too much for my brain to handle in the moment.

# The Good

## Moves and Objectives

Capital M Moves are the bread and butter of Powered by the Apocalypse style games. After reading a few PbtA rulebooks, I got the impression that Moves were a great way of constraining roleplay just enough to help players get into their characters minds and help them figure out what kinds of things they would do and say. Now that I've actually played a PbtA game I can confirm that's exactly what they do. It's interesting how a limited set of broad kinds of actions you can take as a player felt more freeing than the equivalent to a blank page that you often get in other games, especially the OSR-style adventure games that I'm much more used to playing these days.

The oneshot section of the rules contain a list of objectives like "Make aggressively strong choices" and "Put your Characters in bad situations" which combined with the Moves that I had access to felt like being given permission to be an in-character asshole at the table and produce interesting conflicts and scenes as a result of that.

Without the appropriate rules and tools to support this kind of play, I would have felt comfortable being as bold as I was during this session.

For example, one of the Athletes moves is "Lash out at someone and injure them" which exemplifies the loose and broad style of Moves in Sleepaway.

I interpreted this lashing out as verbal rather than physical and so when Sam, the Fresh Blood, a fellow councilor, started crying and puking at the sight of a dead camper, Burt lashed out at Sam.

> Burt: "These campers need you to be strong. You're a fucking disgrace. You should be ashamed of yourself".

Sam's player Sparky TODO took that in stride and used a move on his sheet in response: "Do something you didnâ€™t think you were capable of doing". Sam stood up to the beast of a man towering over him, Burt, gaining his respect for having finally stood up for himself and grown in the process.

This was cool as hell and it would have never in a million years happened in one of my OSR games. You can bet that I'll be on the hunt for more story game experiences moving forward because of this scene in particular.

## Character Creation Process

Simple and quick yet left a lot of room for ideation based on the little of it there is.

Despite it not coming up explicitly in the session itself, I thought the Burt's coach/mentor being his homophobic dad would be a good premise that would explain some of the emotional repression and outbursts that are built into the character's moves.

The character description, the simple pick lists that you choose from combined with the moves that you have access to made me feel ready to roleplay my character. I can't say the same for most games, including {{< book_url "9781913032111" >}} which I'm playing in right now, even after having written 2 pages of backstory, motivations and "stock" phrases I can say.

## Camp Creation Process

Cutting up the camp into sections that each player can contribute to was great

I liked the campgrounds that we created together and the sense of place that it provided.

Collaborative world building is a great way to involve all the players and get them invested in the world they're going to be playing in.

I would do this almost anytime I roleplay moving forward.

# Conclusion

> Take action, leaving yourself vulnerable.

Even though I'm much more familiar with OSR-style TTRPGs, this one session of Sleepaway has convinced me that I've really been missing out and that I should play more story games.

As long as I can find people who'll bear with me "dropping the ball" here and there while I get better at it.
