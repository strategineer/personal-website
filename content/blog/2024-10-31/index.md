Mort by Terry Pratchett was an interesting follow up to Yalom's Existential Psychotherapy. As is common in Pratchett's work, Mort is filled to the brim with philosophically, psychological and political ideas that are implied,  briefly mentioned or simply used as gags.

Mort is no exception to this. 

In Mort, we follow the story of the goofy awkward teen Mortimer as he becomes Death's apprentice. With Mortimer eventually taking Death's job, leaving Death to explore his late retirement.

Early on in executing his duties, Mort finds himself smitten by a princess destined to die, assassinated by an advisor. Mort saves her life and in doing so breaks the universe's causality, creating the conflict that will take the whole novel to resolve.

It's fun and it's interesting and like any good text provides you as the attentive reader with many ideas to explore and pontificate about.

Just to name a single one. In Mort, it's revealed that what happens to a person when they die is whatever they believed in when they were alive.  So Discworld's version is the Dalai Lama believes that he will be reincarnated in the body of a baby born around the same time as his death. 

His belief in this way of the work makes it true (Terry Pratchett also explores this idea in Small Gods).

Of course, we can easily imagine why a fiction writer, who's job is to create fictional worlds that people can believe in,  would want to explore this idea.

But believing in something hard enough making it real is a very real thing because we each perceive the world in a unique way and our beliefs do in fact shape our reality to some extent.

It's also an attractive idea for people who feel powerless.

How do we bring ideas forth into physical reality, well the first step is thought and the next is action.

Brom's Slewfoot follows the story of Tabitha, a young woman who's shipped off to the New World around 1666 (hehe) to be married off to a man living in a Puritan community. She struggles to fit in and finds quickly finds herself at odds with the community, forced to fend for herself and deal with the spirits and shit.

Brom's grimdark take on Peter Pan, The Child Thief, like Slewfoot grounds the fantastical mythical story by featuring human fish out of water POVs and mythical POVs. Both novels feature similar characters,  The Horned God, and depict organized religion in a mostly negative light. 

Slewfoot is a much easier text to recommend than the Child Thief because it handles its subject matter more uniformly. well.
