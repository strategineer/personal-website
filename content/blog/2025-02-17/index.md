I'm absolutely living the Canadian Dream right now.

I dug out my car, got stuck, wiggled it back and forth to get unstuck, drove 20 feet, parked it, went back inside. It took me an 1h and a half with some detours along the way (cleaning the building's stairs)

the absurdity of all this is that I've got an indoor parking spot, sadly the elevator company that's replacing our elevator stacked dozens of buckets filled with hydraulic fluid in it.

I have an anxiety about speaking to people I don't know on the phone. The quality of the phone calls make something that's already hard enough for me even harder.

I like snow but not 50cm of it.
