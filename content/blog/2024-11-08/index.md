Have you been playing Doom II recently?

Probably not, but I have.

Why have I been playing a ~31 year old game in 2024?

Well, it's simple really. It's fun. Other people think so too and that's why in the many decades since the release of Doom in 1993, a community of mappers has developed and have been hard at work using the framework of Doom and, especially its sequel Doom II, to create more, and better, Doom than you'd be able to get through in a lifetime.

Doom holds a special place in my heart being the first video game I ever played. So yes, I'm biased but removing as much nostalgia from the equation as I can, I feel comfortable saying that the core Doom II gameplay loop holds up in 2024 and many great when you play if you're like me and are also interested in  the ecosystem  when you consider that  combined with the improvements in map design each mapper building on what came before and evolving it make for an experience in 2024 that feels really.

If you want to join in on the fun, do this:
- [Download the doom II wad from archive.org](https://archive.org/download/doom_wad_files/Doom%202/).
- [Download some maps, a good place to start is the annual Cacoawards](https://www.doomworld.com/cacowards/).
- [Download dsda-doom, a modern source port of Doom](https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-doom).
- [Combine everything in Doomrunner](https://github.com/Youda008/DoomRunner).

# why play doom in 2024

- healthy map maker community means you'll have new maps to play forever
- rewind
- auto-generated minimap showing locked doors if you get lost
- gameplay holds up and you can play it at 5000 FPS

# Machete - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Those scum ridden sacks of shit didn't even have the empathy to honorably discharge me. I was just told to shut up and get out. I cleared a tech base of those nightmares and I bet they'd still rather see me dead than holding a place in the marines again. I don't need help, I just need to wipe out the rest of these terrors and get rid of that awful noise. Onward to Sunveil Starport.

- cacoaward 2023
- gameplay, using all the systems well and building on similar ideas in subsequent levels, optional harder sublevels within levels clearly marked as such (see an exit but you can keep going too)
- reusing the same arena and re-populutating it once or even twice with different enemies, efficient use of space
- cool custom enemies (cracked evil doom guy, ifrit)
- lvl 29... go through a part of a bunch of previous levels again but with different enemies/stakes... very cool
- what about the story? there's weird shit going on here
- a little slaughtery
- wacky credits (it never ends???), our hero?
- doing a lot with a little

# what lies beneath - ⭐⭐⭐__

- gothic horror, moody, starts off entering a spooky mansion and descending into the dungeon...
- sort of like wad where you go up an elevator in a skyscraper but reversed?
- vibes on point, gameplay not as tight, feels a little random enemy spawn-wise
- great music
- lack of consistency in vision and game mechanics and progression of ideas..., too many cooks, but each level has a lot of love put into it
- map4 blacksite: sick
- I think I'd take a group of less interesting less good maps that are thematically vibewise and gameplay wise cohesive than hodge podge of better maps 
- map8: where fools always trespass, elevator sequence
- really too hodge podgy mix and match, lack of cohesion, but the highs are high. not my preference but very cool levels in here
- map11: falling platforms section
- last map might be a little too big

## Fallen Leaves - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

- great start, great music, tight combat, awesome color palette
- short and sweet, high polish

## Atonement - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ _

Unluckily, you've spawned right in the midst of a trap. The demons have already made it to Earth. It seems like you have just two options of atonement:

Save Earth or die trying.

- a mega mad made by one person of 5 years, and it feels like it for better or worse.
- music is a little "coffebreak" a little elevator music, lacks the propulsive or mystical quality that I'm usually looking for.
- The first few maps are serviceable and interesting but lack a certain jenesaisquoi. These were created first in the author's DOOM mapping journey, so this makes sense. They've been touched up after the fact so they're not horrible but they're just OK.
- Music gets better after the first 1/3 (map12 track pretty great).
- 13: mall center, now we're "gaming", solid mapping
- 14: the music gets kicking here
- 15: back to low fi beat to kill demons to, not my favorite
- 16: music kicks in exactly at the halfway point

## Zone 400 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ _

{{< quote >}}

After 12,000 linedefs of action, you have won this battle and have destroyed the source of this demonic civilization. Condemnation is no more and the mystery of this pandemic has finally been solved. As you hop onto the derelict imperial space station Ondor (sic) for the long journey back home you destroy the rest of these beasts with ease blasting them to oblivion.

- 400 line defs each megawad by one mapper
- mostly consistent map length feels good\
- economy of design, reusing the same spaces over and over again. A little bit of difficulty in differentiating the levels. There's an intentional use of different textures-sets throughout but it's not enough to really make these maps feel really different.
- gradual expansion of arenas and combination of them as more monster closets are revealed.
- ... I like this more than I would have expected.
- a lot of random TPs used to move enemies around the arenas... interesting but hard to parse. Makes the maps feel a little random. It feels like a bandaid to solve the problem of wanting to have these maps be tiny but re-use the existing spaces a bunch... it doesn't fully work.
- map11: great example of this idea of opening an arena gradually
- timed buttons keep the pace up but sometimes slow you down when you miss the timing.
- singular/low rocket ammo drops, forces tactical rocket use more than usual
- maps separated into mostly thematic episodes with different map design ethos/pillars in each it feels like... it's good 
- 2020 pandemic-inspired story line
