Have you been playing Doom II recently?

Probably not, but I have.

Why have I been playing a ~31 year old game in 2024?

Well, it's simple really. It's fun. Other people think so too and that's why in the many decades since the release of Doom in 1993, a community of mappers has developed and have been hard at work using the framework of Doom and, especially its sequel Doom II, to create more, and better, Doom than you'd be able to get through in a lifetime.

Doom holds a special place in my heart being the first video game I ever played. So yes, I'm biased but removing as much nostalgia from the equation as I can, I feel comfortable saying that the core Doom II gameplay loop holds up in 2024 and many great when you play if you're like me and are also interested in  the ecosystem  when you consider that  combined with the improvements in map design each mapper building on what came before and evolving it make for an experience in 2024 that feels really.

If you want to join in on the fun, do this:
- [Download the doom II wad from archive.org](https://archive.org/download/doom_wad_files/Doom%202/).
- [Download some maps, a good place to start is the annual Cacoawards](https://www.doomworld.com/cacowards/).
- [Download dsda-doom, a modern source port of Doom](https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-doom).
- [Combine everything in Doomrunner](https://github.com/Youda008/DoomRunner).

# why play doom in 2024

- healthy map maker community means you'll have new maps to play forever
- rewind
- auto-generated minimap showing locked doors if you get lost
- gameplay holds up and you can play it at 5000 FPS

- once again, this map01 track is crazy. Music makes the wad sing for me.
