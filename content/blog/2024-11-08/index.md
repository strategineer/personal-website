Have you been playing Doom II recently?

Probably not, but I have.

Why have I been playing a ~31 year old game in 2024?

Well, it's simple really. It's fun. Other people think so too and that's why in the many decades since the release of Doom in 1993, a community of mappers has developed and have been hard at work using the framework of Doom and, especially its sequel Doom II, to create more, and better, Doom than you'd be able to get through in a lifetime.

Doom holds a special place in my heart being the first video game I ever played. So yes, I'm biased but removing as much nostalgia from the equation as I can, I feel comfortable saying that the core Doom II gameplay loop holds up in 2024 and many great when you play if you're like me and are also interested in  the ecosystem  when you consider that  combined with the improvements in map design each mapper building on what came before and evolving it make for an experience in 2024 that feels really.

If you want to join in on the fun, do this:
- [Download the doom II wad from archive.org](https://archive.org/download/doom_wad_files/Doom%202/).
- [Download some maps, a good place to start is the annual Cacoawards](https://www.doomworld.com/cacowards/).
- [Download dsda-doom, a modern source port of Doom](https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-doom).
- [Combine everything in Doomrunner](https://github.com/Youda008/DoomRunner).

# why play doom in 2024

- healthy map maker community means you'll have new maps to play forever
- rewind
- auto-generated minimap showing locked doors if you get lost
- gameplay holds up and you can play it at 5000 FPS

# doom mapping retrospective

speed001

- simple, short, shit, looks bad
- as simple as you can get, at least you can finish it

speed002

- looks way better than speed001, there's a much better sense of place.
- Mixed monster spawns leads to immediate infighting which ruins the combat feel
- not enough health packs and weapons not given quickly enough or at all
- no ssg yikes
- not enough ammo for full clear and no berserk pack

castle_of_doom

- I always want to have an ssg right away, playing without it is pain.
  - How do mappers make it feel less shit playing without the SSG? No tanky enemies until you get it?
- first community project, speedmap
- yellow skull, nothing changes when I pick it up but monsters should have been revealed while backtracking to the middle. Make things less boring
- super slowly descending "secret" platforms are so painful. 10 secrets per map was a requirement of the CP but these secrets are really shit
- better but not great
- we'll be revisiting this spoke design in ourobouros
