# why play doom in 2024

- healthy map maker community means you'll have new maps to play forever
- rewind
- auto-generated minimap showing locked doors if you get lost
- gameplay holds up and you can play it at 5000 FPS

# Machete - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

cacoaward 2023

gameplay, using all the systems well and building on similar ideas in subsequent levels, optional harder sublevels within levels clearly marked as such (see an exit but you can keep going too)

reusing the same arena and re-populutating it once or even twice with different enemies, efficient use of space

cool custom enemies (cracked evil doom guy, ifrit)

lvl 29... go through a part of a bunch of previous levels again but with different enemies/stakes... very cool

what about the story? there's weird shit going on here

a little slaughtery

wacky credits (it never ends???)

our hero?

doing a lot with a little

# what lies beneath - ⭐⭐⭐__

gothic horror, moody, starts off entering a spooky mansion and descending into the dungeon...

sort of like wad where you go up an elevator in a skyscraper but reversed?

vibes on point, gameplay not as tight, feels a little random enemy spawn-wise

great music

lack of consistency in vision and game mechanics and progression of ideas..., too many cooks, but each level has a lot of love put into it

map4 blacksite: sick

I think I'd take a group of less interesting less good maps that are thematically vibewise and gameplay wise cohesive than hodge podge of better maps 

map8: where fools always trespass, elevator sequence

really too hodge podgy mix and match, lack of cohesion, but the highs are high. not my preference but very cool levels in here

map11: falling platforms section

last map might be a little too big

## Fallen Leaves - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

great start, great music, tight combat, awesome color palette

## Atonement - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ _

https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/megawads/atone

a mega mad made by one person of 5 years, and it feels like it for better or worse.

music is a little "coffebreak" a little elevator music, lacks the propulsive or mystical quality that I'm usually looking for.

The first few maps are serviceable and interesting but lack a certain jenesaisquoi. These were created first in the author's DOOM mapping journey, so this makes sense. They've been touched up after the fact so they're not horrible but they're just OK.

Music gets better after the first 1/3 (map12 track pretty great).

13: mall center, now we're "gaming", solid mapping
14: the music gets kicking here
15: back to low fi beat to kill demons to, not my favorite
16: music kicks in exactly at the halfway point

## Zone 400 - _ _ _ _ _

400 line defs each megawad by one mapper

mostly consistent map length feels good
