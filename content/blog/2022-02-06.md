Sifting through the filtered photographs

Left and right, left and right

It was love at first swipe.

Balsamic vinegar,

"It's healthy", they said. "It's good for you."

But, healthy salad makes me a sad lad.

Choking on a piece of bread,

"Chew before you swallow", they said,

I didn't listen and now I'm dead.

---

Flames engulf us,

As I hold on to you, tight.

Are you feeling this?

I hope you are.

I'll see you on the other side.

---

Listen to the static.

The static that surrounds us.

Let it consume you.

You're nothing without it.
