All of the tabletop RPG systems (and some modules) that I'm familiar with are gathering together today to party like it's 2025 and they've all brought something to the table (my brain).

In no particular order, here's a show and tell of mechanics that blew my mind from TTRPG systems that I've played and/or run in the past few years.

# Spark Tables

In Maze Rats, after a long rest, PCs with one or more spell slots rolls on a series of three different tables to generate each spell's name, with the mechanics of the spell being determined by the GM based on the name.

For example, rolling on the first table might produce an Ethereal Effect and Physical Element spell, two subsequent rolls on the relevant tables might result in a spell named "Bewildering Insect".

Then, the GM will quickly make a ruling about what the spell will do when cast to give guidance to the player on how it might be used ("Bewildering Insect will materialize an insect of your choice, the sight of which will temporarily confuse anyone who sees it.").

When the PC casts the spell, the GM can nail down the specifics based on context and the player's ingenuity ("Arggg the Bridge Troll-in-Training sees the 3 foot tall cockroach you created and becomes confused for one round, deciding who to stop from crossing the bridge, the roach or the party.").

This a great tool for easily generating specific things (in this case, spells) that players can latch onto and have fun with, without being burdened by the cost of specifying everything in detail and in doing so limit the potential of said generated thing.

Using words, latent with meaning, as the fulcrum for leveraging more specific randomness into your play while retaining the inherent flexibility of words is a genius design choice and I can see myself using spark tables like this for other GMing purposes like generating NPCs.

# Exploding Dice, the Wild Die and Raises

In Savage Worlds, skill checks involve rolling two dice, your skill die which can be anything from a d4 to d12 and a Wild die which is always a d6.

Both of these dice are rolled separately and they can both "explode" (if you roll the highest number on a die, then you roll the die again, adding both results to the total, repeating this process until the die doesn't explode).

The highest total between both of these rolls is the result of the skill check. If it's higher than the DC of the skill check you succeed, otherwise you fail.

Simple enough, right? But, each increment of four that the result is higher the DC of the check produces a "raise". Depending on the pulpy-ness of the setting, the GM can then decide how the skill check resolves in the PC's favor, going above and beyond simply succeeding based on the number of raises.

Rolling big numbers is fun, having no upper limit to how big these numbers can get is really fun, having these gigantic numbers directly contribute to unforgettable roleplaying moments is something you can only with a system like Savage Worlds.

# Beats

Essentially, beats are a list of "story beats" that players want their PCs to participate in during play, once they've the beat is over, they get a level up.

This is a system for ensuring that both players and the GM are on the same page as to how the PCs should and naturally forms a storyline and arc for the characters as they descend deeper into the Heart.

Although Beats aren't as easy to homebrew into any system you might be playing with, I've found that by using the [Stars and Wishes](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/stars-and-wishes) tool I can achieve a similar effect on my games by giving players the explicit opportunity to tell me, the GM, what they liked about a session and what they would like to see in subsequent ones.

# The Death Timer

Whenever a PC falls to zero HP or below, the rules dictate that you roll a d4 plus the PC's constitution score. The result is the number of rounds that the PC has before they are fully dead.

Inspired by the Death Save rule in Mothership, my simple twist on Shadowdark's Death Timer rule (which I used over and over again [in my Shadowdark RPG Maze of the Blue Medusa campaign](/blog/2025-01-23/#running-a-high-lethality-survival-horror-like-campaign)) is that this roll is done in secret and the result is only seen by the GM.

Turning every potential PC death into a recurring high intensity risk vs. reward combat situation that everyone at the table is super invested in is a master class in design especially when combined with high lethality OSR-style gameplay.

I will never run an OSR game without at least considering bringing some version of this rule to the table because of how effective it is in raising the stakes over and over again. Theoretically, a rule like this might make a game less lethal by reducing the likelihood of death, for example in a system like {{< book_url "Maze Rats">}} where a PC falling to zero HP or below means instant death, but if that's a problem then the GM can ramp up the difficulty accordingly to account for this.

# The In-Character Debriefing

Paranoia is a great system, it's bold, evocative and extremely English. If you forced me to pick the thing about it that I really like, it would be the debriefing that the PCs have with their supervising officer. It's a fantastic way to end a session on a high note, reminding players of all the choices they made and the hijinks they got themselves into, amplifying the fun of it all.

Explicitly applying this rule broadly into other systems isn't very easy unless you're playing something like {{< book_url "9798218255299" >}} or {{< book_url "9781944413217" >}} where the PCs are soldiers sent out on missions. In games like this, it would be expected to return to base after every mission to debrief with their supervising officer.

If you're playing a game where this isn't the case, then I've found that pushing myself to have NPCs simply ask questions to the PCs about the things they've done recently despite all the players and the GM knowing fully well what they did and the hijinks they got themselves into.

Giving the PCs an opportunity to gloat, reflect, display pride about their actions in in-universe often makes for great roleplay.

# The Calendar of Nechrubel

In MÃ¶rk Borg, at dawn, the GM rolls a die, on a one, a catastrophe is unleashed upon the world and after seven of these catastrophes have crippled the world beyond repair, the world ends.

Conceptually this is really cool but mechanically it provides an explicit timer and eventual end to the campaign.

As you've likely experienced yourself, many campaigns peter out. Having an explicit timer provides a sense of urgency and raises the stakes at the table.

Not to mention that knowing that the end is nigh, provides a lot of interesting roleplaying opportunities. What do the PCs choose to do when they know that the world is going to end in a few days? Answering those kinds of questions at the table can be really fun.

Not every campaign needs to be framed with a world-ending apocalypse. But, most campaigns could be improved by the GM thinking constantly about the passage of time and how it can impact the world at the table. For example, what if there's a big dungeon with a ton of loot and people living in it. How would the PCs react if they knew that the dungeon was going to collapse in 7 days?

It would be hard to bring all these different mechanics to a non-Savage Worlds table but there's an easy solution for that, play Savage Worlds.

Otherwise, most TTRPGs can be massaged to allow for players succeeding at what they're trying to do and getting way more than what they expected when the dice fall in their favor. Your players will not complain about this.

# Connections

I already [wrote quite a bit about my obsession with forcing players to come up with connections their PCs have with each other and other characters in the world](/blog/2024-11-18/#force-players-to-think-about-relationships-between-their-own-characters-and-the-setting-during-character-creation) so I'll keep this short.

Determining how the PCs know each other and who they know in the world during character creation does wonders for giving the GM something to riff off of and help build the world before the first session even begins. And, it gives players an initial thrust into thinking about their PC as something more than just a sheet of stats.

Also, letting players contribute meaningfully to the setting of the game right from the start is great for me because I'm interested in collaborative storytelling and it turns out that when players contribute to the story being told at the table, they end up enjoying it way more.

# Conclusion

And now, the potluck is popping off. There were a few TTRPGs that I *forgot* to send invitations to (*cough* F.A.T.A.L. *cough*). That's because I knew that they wouldn't have brought anything interesting to the table other than the idea that TTRPGs sometimes have more to say about the people designing them than the world they're seeking to describe and systematize.

Every TTRPG you play presents you with an opportunity to think about what someone else's conception on what "fun" roleplaying is and see how that fits into your own.

What TTRPG have you played recently and what would they bring to your potluck?
