Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I don't want to bathe in the blood of my enemies againnnnnnnnnnn.

Huh.

But, I do it anyway because it's what my boss, my colleagues and my employees expect of me.

Keeping up appearances is important when you're leading a horde of fanatics across the galaxy in a quest to conquer and kill everyone and everything.

I am but a cog in the machine upholding the status quo in charge of killing any living being that steps out of line.

My horde of pencil-pushers would be sent to poke me full of holes, if one day I was to decide to stop bathing in the blood of my so called enemies.

And so, I close my eyes and let the blood wash over me as I dream of a world in which I'm able to do as I please.
