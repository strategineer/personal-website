> Fade in, camera on interviewee (Kevin) dressed cleanly sat on chair in office.
> Kevin sits still, in slightly stressed position.

Kevin: My name is Kevin. Uh. Kevin Whitaker. I work in the finance department.
I'm not really sure why I'm here. Am I in trouble?

> Cut, quick fade in fade out. Kevin more relaxed, smiling.

Kevin: I got really into it. Ummmm. I was angry all the time, frustrated with
everything and everyone... (exasperated sigh) I was in a really bad place.

(no cut, pregnant pause)

Kevin: But that was before, I'm different now. I'm OK... All it took was one big
change in my life and (snaps fingers) bang!

> Gunshot sound leading to (static noise), Cut to Kevin gesticulating gently
> with eyes growing wilder.

Kevin: Once you start to grasp how the world really works, nothing is the same
anymore. Open your eyes, can't you see what I see?

> (static noise), Cut to Kevin holding his knees, shaking his head and
> muttering.

Kevin: It's all a game. It's all a game. It's all a game. It's all a game. It's
all a game. It's all a game. It's all a game. It's all a game.

> (static noise) Cut to Kevin, facing away from the camera, sits on chair with
> his knees, slowly turning his next around to face the camera.

> (static noise) Cut to Kevin stands next to camera, towering over and past it.

Kevin: (demonic whisper) annihilate your consciousness

> Kevin knocks camera over, rushing past it, growling ferally.

> (static noise) camera still knocked over, Cut to Kevin face down on floor
> twitching erraticaly.

> Camera placed properly again slightly different position, Kevin,
> expressionless, breathes out meditatively, sits on chair, gets up and walks
> away. Kevin can be heard muttering to himself while rummaging through some
> trash off screen.

(pregnant pause)

> Camera is turned off.

> (static noise) repeats for a minute.
