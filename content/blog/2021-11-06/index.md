I took me years of writing about video games (a visual medium) on here before I
finally decided it was about time to make it easy for me to insert images with
optional captions into my blog posts...

Well, here you go.

This is some text before the image.

This is some text after the image.

It took me about 30min to get this to work.

I regret not doing this much earlier.

But you know what they say?
