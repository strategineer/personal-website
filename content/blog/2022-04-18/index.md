Hi, my name's [NAME]. I've lived in [CITY], [COUNTRY] my whole life.

I've worked in the flight simulator space, the video game world, in special effects and, most recently, in financial services.

I'm _d√©brouillard_ meaning that no matter what problem you throw at me, inevitably, I'll figure it out and solve it. I thrive in environments where there's lots of interesting problems to solve. That's what peeked my initial interest in [COMPANY] and I'm happy to be here.

I like:

- biking when it's nice out; squatting and flailing my arms around in VR when it's not.
- writing [on my blog](/blog/2022-01-14/) about anything.
- playing tabletop roleplaying games with friends despite not being very good at it.
- being walked by my family's dog.
- learning (AMA about media literacy).

I'm excited to work with you all.
