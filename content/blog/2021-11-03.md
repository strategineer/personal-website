I forgot to set my alarm last night, so I woke up 2h after I was expecting to and that's thrown off my entire day. I can't fix this by going to sleep 2h later than usual because I want to get a good night's sleep and I want to wake up at my usual time (6:30am).

So here I am, living through a day that's shorter than it's supposed to be. And yet, I still want to do everything I had initially planned to do but I'm not going to be able to. Well, what can you do? I'll remember to set my alarm today and I'll try to do as much as I can.

At least I can do something about it. Every night, there are people who go to sleep only to never wake up again. Alarm or no alarm.

Am I spending the little time I have on this Earth wisely?

No matter what you do, the universe's clock keeps ticking, and if you're not careful, one day you'll blink, and it'll all be gone.
