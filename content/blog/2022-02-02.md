Let the beetles beat their drums

Waves reflecting off the sun

Yet, the war has just begun

----------------

Previously potted plant, shards everywhere

Uprooted but far from death,

A survivor, stronger than ever

Mint never gave up.

----------------

Twelve or more weeks later, disremembered

Gone forever but not forgotten

Brother, who would you have been?
