title: The Overjustification Effect

I learned to code sometime in 2011. I started getting paid to code in 2016.

What started out as a passion turned into a job. This sometimes leads to what's
called the
[overjustification effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect).

> The overjustification effect occurs when an expected external incentive such
> as money or prizes decreases a person's intrinsic motivation to perform a
> task. Overjustification is an explanation for the phenomenon known as
> motivational "crowding out". The overall effect of offering a reward for a
> previously unrewarded activity is a shift to extrinsic motivation and the
> undermining of pre-existing intrinsic motivation. Once rewards are no longer
> offered, interest in the activity is lost; prior intrinsic motivation does not
> return, and extrinsic rewards must be continuously offered as motivation to
> sustain the activity.[^1]

Despite being paid to write code for the past several years now, I'm still in
love with it.

Although my relationship to my passion has changed over time. I work full-time
as a software engineer and so at the end of the day I'm, usually, "all coded
out".

That's not always the case though. In the past few months, I've worked on
[a mod for the criminally underappreciated game Pig Eat Ball](https://github.com/strategineer/speedrun-tools-peb),
[a Discord bot to help some friends and I play the tabletop RPG Everyone Is John](https://github.com/strategineer/discord-bot)
and
[a little web app to explore and share Marcus Aurelius's Meditations](/blog/2022-01-26/).

These projects were all small in scope and so I was able to sneak them into my
schedule.

These past few years, I noticed that I've spent a lot of my free time working on
creative projects purely for my own enjoyment.

I write about video games on this blog (worth nothing) and I work on little
programming projects for fun (worth nothing to anyone but me).

I wonder if I'm subconsciously going out of my way to work on projects that have
no value to anyone but myself because I don't want to be put in a situation
where I'm paid for any of this.

If I start getting paid for my creative output, maybe I'll stop having as much
fun creating it?

"Wasting" my time on creative projects that have no value is a luxury I can
afford. My skills as a software engineer are highly sought after and so I'm paid
well for the work I do during the day.

I live a life of privilege and I hope I can continue having fun creating
unsellable stuff until the day they unceremoniously shove me into the dirt.
