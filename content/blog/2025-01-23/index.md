Running a tabletop RPG campaign is always a learning experience. In this post, I'll share insights from my recent campaign, 'Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon', and lessons I learned as a GM.

<!--more-->

I ran the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon using the Shadowdark RPG rules through the Foundry virtual tabletop tool over the course of 4 months between September 2024 and January 2025.

Now, I'll go over the lessons learned about each of these parts individually and then cover the insights gained from combining them all together for the campaign.

# Shadowdark RPG

## What's cool about Shadowdark RPG?

### Concise, efficient rules

I've read a bunch of different [OSR](#glossary) roleplaying rulebooks and out of all of those I chose Shadowdark for this campaign.

There's a lot to like about Shadowdark but its defining feature is that it's surprisingly **elegant** (considering that it won the [Ennie Award for Best Game in 2024](https://ennie-awards.com/portfolio-item/2024-nominees-and-winners/) this shouldn't come as too much of a surprise).

The rulebook is a masterpiece of design --- it's one of the best laid out rulebooks I've read. The rules are concise, clear and comprehensive enough to allow new and experienced GMs to run Shadowdark games well after reading it.

### A great OSR system for less experienced GMs

The Shadowdark RPG rulebook is incredibly helpful for GMs. It doesn't assume years of experience and provides clear instructions on how to run the game.

For example, how do you as the GM emphasise the danger and urgency of exploring a dark dank dungeon? A lot of OSR systems assume that you as the GM already know how to do this...

The Shadowdark RPG rules go out of their way to give GMs, who've never run an OSR game like this before, guidance on how to do exactly this.

Shadowdark's masterstroke is that 10 minutes of real-time represents 10 minutes of game-time (unless of course you've explicitly chosen to fast-forward through something).

And, every so often depending on how dangerous the area the PCs are in, you'll roll a d6 to check for a random encounter. On a 1, the PCs encounter something or someone.

This makes it clear for everyone at the table that spending real-time discussing what to do next or spending game-time searching under every tile in a room for traps brings the risk of a random encounter with it.

So, players are encouraged by the system to just **do** something which tends to be more fun and keeps the game from becoming a slog.

While experienced GMs can solve these problems intuitively, Shadowdark RPG provides explicit guidance, which is incredibly helpful for new GMs. This ethos makes Shadowdark RPG stand out among its OSR peers.

I can't stress how amazingly concise and useful the rulebook is. But it's not a perfect fit for every OSR campaign you're going to run.

## What's less cool about Shadowdark RPG?

### Supplemental classes are inconsistent

Some of the classes found in the Shadowdark official zines feel out of place, too strong or too weird compared to the classic Fighter/Rogue/Wizard/Cleric classes we know and love described in the core rulebook.

Although it didn't cause any serious problems in our campaign, it was an interesting challenge balancing combat encounters involving both our dwarven Pit Fighter Brod with 30 HP with a bunch of abilities that made him really hard to kill as well as Blotbug, our 4 HP goblin Witch.

I would think carefully about allowing players to play any of these extra classes, especially if you're looking to double down the old school dungeon crawling experience.

### Darkness rules are hard to use

The only thing that isn't elegant about Shadowdark RPG is its handling of darkness and how little it helps you run a fun game where light is a resource that has to be managed.

Unless you can figure out how to fill your dungeons with water splashing enemies (like the book recommends) without making the dungeons feel more like waterparks, you might run into the same problems I did.

Thankfully, I found that the game works fine even if you mostly ignore the darkness rules.

Having discussed the Shadowdark RPG system, now let's dive into the heart of my campaign --- the megadungeon itself.

# Maze of the Blue Medusa

## What's cool about the Maze of the Blue Medusa?

I read dozens of modules in preparation for running this campaign. I was looking for something special to give myself the solid foundation I felt like I needed to help me run my best campaign yet.

The Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon fit that bill perfectly --- it's cool, it's out there and it's also very me.

### Great abstract, surreal art combined with evocative descriptions

The Maze of the Blue Medusa is a product of a collaboration between Zak Sabbath and Patrick Stuart where Sabbath drew abstract, surreal room art to set the tone and would pass his art on to Stuart who would then write descriptions to breathe life into each area.

This back-and-forth continued for several years producing the one-of-a-kind Maze of the Blue Medusa.

Despite this process, the megadungeon isn't as funhousey as you might expect. The megadungeon is partitioned into several sections with common visual, literary and gameplay themes spread throughout which helps connect the rooms together into a cohesive whole.

### Weird, unique NPCs

Several interesting factions and NPCs inhabit the dungeon. The GM can leverage these to further connect the disparate sections of the maze with each other and, in doing so, make the dungeon come alive for your players.

There are hundreds of NPCs in the Maze of the Blue Medusa and I can imagine that any one of them could become a character that your players never forget for the rest of their lives.

It's hard to understate how out there and unique most of the NPCs are.

### Interesting old school dungeon crawling combat and puzzles

Generally, the Maze of the Blue Medusa contains rooms that provide interesting classic old school dungeon crawling style challenges to overcome.

A defining feature of our campaign was the building and maintenance of a "Super Rake". After the party discovered a shed filled gardening tools, Marlon, the party's rogue, attached the head of a rake to his 10ft pole.

Marlon whipped it out whenever he could (which was often). For example, he used it, from a safe distance, to poke at moving vines that were constantly reshaping themselves into the shape of a woman's face.

### Everything is weird

Despite providing ample classic dungeon crawling puzzles and combat encounters, the Maze of the Blue Medusa refuses to play any of it straight --- every room, every NPC and every puzzle will be a little surreal, a little absurdist, a little mythical, a little weird and that's what got me interested in the Maze of the Blue Medusa in the first place.

For example, you can expect players to encounter psychic pigs, laughing liches, book-worms, robotic peacock butlers, cannibal critics (they eat artists), I could go on.

As long as your players are open-minded enough to play in an off-kilter fantasy environment then the Maze of the Blue Medusa will provide that in spades.

It executes this weird vibe so well that even though the megadungeon isn't perfect --- what it does do well is so unique and cool that it more than makes up for its minor failings.

Let's discuss what makes the Maze of the Blue Medusa less than perfect.

## What's less cool about the Maze of the Blue Medusa?

### Some exceptionally boring rooms

The Maze of the Blue Medusa is a big megadungeon and not all parts of it are created equally. Even though the quality of rooms is pretty high overall, there's a few that fall short.
 
An example of one is room 48 - Nui-Nga-Ma:

{{< spoiler >}}
A shell, 8' long, white, and patterned in green-white whorls the color of new leaves holding a layer of fresh unseasonal snow. Living in the shell is a large snail. Its limbs wave uncertainly like fingers seen through whiskey, somewhat transparent and indistinct.

Nui-Nga-Ma is not a true snail but a kind of golem created by Aelfadred The Glyph Witch (Gardens 58). She can hear anything the snail hears through a shell she keeps in her room. Likewise, Nui-Nga-Ma can hear anything that happens near the other shell.

**Niu-Nga-Ma**

AC 16, HD 4, ATK d8/d8
{{< /spoiler >}}

The way a GM could make this "encounter" interesting is beyond me.

There's a few rooms in the Maze of the Blue Medusa that asked me to fill in the gaps way more than I was prepared for and as a result left me scratching my head in confusion (which is never a good position for a GM to find themselves in at the table).

I imagine that a more well-prepared and/or experienced GM would be able to read a room description like this and decide to replace it with something else on the fly. That wasn't the case for me most of the time.

### Some players won't vibe with the abstract surreal art

The drawings are quite abstract and don't do a good job of conveying what NPCs in particular actually look like. This proved to be a problem for the more visually-focused players in the group.

This put some extra pressure on me as the GM to describe NPCs in evocative ways and to find less abstract token images to represent these NPCs.

This was challenging because of the large number of NPCs in the dungeon and because of their unique looks.

### Interactions between factions are left for the GM to figure out

The Maze of the Blue Medusa book could have done a better job of helping you run it by providing more examples of how the factions could possibly interact with one another in interesting ways.

The book could have been much more explicit about this in more places instead of leaving it mostly up to the GM to make all of these connections on their own.

For example,

{{< spoiler >}}
Bringing the "Oku" (magical bird cosplayers essentially) who are natural rogues and thieves into conflict with the Cannibal Critics who are mostly feral zombies who consume artists and hang out in the art gallery would be a great idea.

The book doesn't mention interactions like this much in the book and I think it'd be better if it did.
{{< /spoiler >}}

So, the Maze of the Blue Medusa is great. The Shadowdark RPG system is great. Let's discuss the challenges of running the Maze of the Blue Medusa using the Shadowdark RPG rules.

# Is Shadowdark RPG a good fit for running the Maze of the Blue Medusa?

Short answer, no.

The Shadowdark RPG seems to hinge on the PCs struggle to light the path forward and avoid darkness at all costs.

I wasn't able to accentuate Shadowdark's many survival horror elements because of my inexperience with the Shadowdark system and its relative incompatibility with Maze of the Blue Medusa.

Large sections of the megadungeon are designed to be well-lit and wouldn't work at all if they weren't. Thankfully, the Shadowdark RPG system holds up even if you ignore all the darkness parts of the rules.

While I'd consider running a Shadowdark RPG campaign again, I wouldn't recommend it for running the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon without some caveats.

# What did I learn GMing this campaign?

## What did I learn GMing a megadungeon?

### Megadungeons are not particularly well suited for player-centric play 

Megadungeons being so big and unexplored initially means that players are limited in their choices to do anything other than continue to open unopened doors in the dungeon.

Eventually, they'll meet factions and NPCs that they might want to interact with but whatever they choose to do with these NPCs, it'll involve opening more doors ad nauseam.

Leaving the dungeon, doing some stuff and going into another dungeon is the stereotypical way a fantasy roleplaying game work. I'd argue that there's a reason for that --- it's much easier to run smaller dungeons, letting players leave them when they want to (usually when they're done) and then return to explore new dungeons instead of the same one over and over again.

### Simulating NPCs is hard

Actions taken with or against NPC factions in one area of the dungeon should be acknowledged and reacted to by at least some of the other factions in the dungeon.

Megadungeons have a lot of factions in them making it that much harder to come up with the reactivity that players expect from these factions because of the number of them.

All this to say, running a megadungeon is hard --- if I were to do it again, here's what I would do.

### Provide clear direction for players early on

Give PCs a dated/incomplete map of the dungeon early on in their journey to give them an initial thrust towards something in the dungeon that interests them.

This would give them destinations to work their way to. Without some sort of direction, exploring a megadungeon can feel a little aimless and, at worst, boring.

No matter how interesting the encounters are, opening doors over and over again gets monotonous after a while unless the PCs have something they're trying to get to or a specific problem to solve.

### Establish a clear goal for the PCs

Whether it's rescuing an NPC, mapping out the dungeon, finding a particular artifact, etc. giving a clear goal for PCs to strive towards will get them moving in a direction instead of aimlessly wandering around a megadungeon hoping to stumble on treasure of some kind.

Trapping PCs in a megadungeon without an established goal (which is what I did in this campaign) wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be and I wouldn't do that again.

Even if you decide that the PCs goal is to find a way out of the dungeon unless the dungeon is specifically built around that goal I don't think it would work very well.

If your players aren't exploring the megadungeon and becoming invested in this vast space and the NPCs that inhabit it, what's the point of running a megadungeon?

### Never trap players without a purpose

If PCs want to leave a dungeon they're trapped in (and they probably would unless you've established a reason for them to continue exploring it), they should be able to.

PCs risking life and limb because they *want* to is more interesting than doing the same because they're *forced* to.

### Give opportunities for players to accelerate their exploration

Populate the megadungeon with more entrances, exits and ways for characters to travel through previously explored regions more quickly. 

I would give PCs more opportunities to find portals for entering/exiting parts of the dungeon, providing them with magical items to facilitate moving between certain places more quickly and maybe even having a quest line centered around setting up an in-dungeon taxi service of some kind. 

Megadungeons are BIG and navigating through previously explored parts of the dungeon over and over again can get tedious even if you re-populate them with roaming encounters of some kind.

My solutions above are a better alternative to fast-forwarding through travel of explored parts of the dungeon because that might set the expectation for players that the dungeon is more static and safe than it should be (safe is boring).

Factions within the dungeon can also make use of these entrance/exits allowing for a more dynamic dungeon and explaining away how certain recurring NPCs might find themselves meeting with the PCs over and over again despite the size of the dungeon.

### Populate the dungeon with other adventuring parties

I would have at least one NPC with a similar overall power level to the PCs exploring the dungeon too.

This would be fun and make the dungeon a bit more dynamic. The PCs can collaborate with them or have a confrontation with them. Essentially, I think a gristled experienced and wise dungeon explorer would be a fun recurring NPC.

### Blow the megadungeon up at a predetermined time

I would set an in-universe timer of some kind, communicate that to the players and PCs in some way and then after X sessions end with a bang.

For example, the dungeon of Titancomeon-man is prophesised to collapse in 30 days time, at that time the dungeon begins to collapse in on itself and the PCs might want to get some of the NPCs out of there, who do they pick?

This would provide a sense of urgency to the PCs's exploration of the dungeon and a clear stopping point. Even if the PCs haven't been able to comb through every single room they'll have to leave the dungeon for good.

### The biggest problem with megadungeons is that they're megadungeons

Megadungeons create more problems than opportunities for good player-centric roleplaying. My curiosity about them has been more than satiated.

I don't see myself running a megadungeon again anytime soon but I can see myself trying to run one again when I have more GMing experience under my belt.

## Give NPCs memorable voices (it's worth the effort!)

I've been roleplaying regularly since 2019 and in that time I've gotten so much better at it.

Despite roleplaying being a hobby I've been interested in for a decade and a half, the skills that I needed to have to enjoy it fully were challenging to acquire.

Putting in the time and effort to get better at every part of it has paid dividends in my roleplaying and outside of it.

I was so happy when I whipped out a voice for a "grumpy old man performing a shitty standup comedy routine" at a party I was attending and I got a really positive reaction for it.

I wouldn't have had the confidence or the skills to do that without forcing myself to do funny voices every week when GMing this campaign.

The Maze of the Blue Medusa features a ton of wild characters and trying, sometimes failing, to give all of them unique voices was a great learning experience and a ton of fun my players and I.

## Write session summaries to help you remember NPCs and player actions to bring up later

Taking note of the big moments in each session gave me more opportunities than I would have had otherwise to weave previous events, player actions and reactions into subsequent sessions.

This helped a ton and I don't see myself running a game again without writing session summaries.

## Give players opportunities to interact with their favorite NPCs

If players really like a particular NPC, I should give them more opportunities to interact with that NPC.

The literal giant book-worm Germander was a big success with my players --- in no small part due to the unhinged voice I used for him.

Sadly, I kept him locked up in his room forcing my players to navigate back and forth through the megadungeon to talk to him.

This meant that the PCs weren't able to interact with him as much I or my players would have liked them to. In the last session of the campaign, I slimmed Germander down in order for him to exit from his prison and follow the party but it was a little too late.

Another way I solved this problem later on in the campaign was with Draco the Laughing Lich. He's a powerful lich who thinks life is meaningless and only cares about finding reasons to laugh.

The party was able to make him laugh a bunch and so he gave them an Amulet of Slapstickification which doubled as a sort of bodycam that Draco could use to watch and comment on the party's actions as they made their way through the dungeon.

I should have also changed the random encounter table to include a "recurring NPC" entry to give myself an extra kick in the ass to have certain NPCs show up on a recurring basis.

An NPC like Lady Crucem Capilli (a dragon/demon English empire-esque colonizer and artifact gatherer lady) would have been a great fit for this considering her inherent mobility.

I liked the voice I had for her, she could have been a fun recurring character and it's a shame I didn't bring her into play more often. 

# Foundry VTT

Foundry [VTT](#glossary) is **the** way to do tabletop roleplaying online no matter the complexity of the system. If someone's been generous enough to implement a roleplaying game system I'd like to run on Foundry VTT, then I will absolutely always play it that way moving forward. It's **that** good.

After years of suffering through Roll20 (a truly god-awful VTT) and building my own shitty VTT-adjacent tools on Discord or Google Sheets, I'm never going back. That's how good Foundry VTT is.

Another reason why I chose the Shadowdark RPG system was because of its great support for play through Foundry VTT.

The only downside is that Foundry VTT requires a bit of setup and has a learning curve. However, the following tools can help ease the process.

## Essential Modules

No matter how well supported your system of choice is in Foundry VTT, the following modules will probably be useful for you:

### Quick Insert gives you instant access to everything in your game

Hitting control and the space bar to get instant drag-and-drop access to everything in your game including things like characters, tokens, items, NPCs, skills, etc. is a godsend.

This module facilitates character creation, inventory management and GMing overall to such an extent that I would never use Foundry without it.

### Dice Tray gives you easily rollable dice when you need them

Dice Tray provides an accessible and easy to use UI for you and your players to roll dice.

In most cases, using the modules below, especially [Token Action HUD](#token-action-hud), you'll rarely need to roll dice outside of the context of the pre-implemented dice rolls coming directly from your character sheet.

But when you do need to, perhaps because of a ruling you've made, using Dice Tray will be easier for most people instead of typing out dice notation formulas in the chat.

### Token Action HUD shows you all the actions your characters can do

Foundry without Token Action HUD is great but a shell of what it can be. If the system you're playing with supports the Token Action HUD family of modules, you'll absolutely want to use it.

It puts a World of Warcraft-esque action bar at the top of your screen whenever you select a PC or NPC token.

With Token Action HUD, you can make a stat roll, an ability/skill check (with all of the appropriate modifiers) for a particular character with just one click.

The crunchier your game is the more essential this module becomes. Showing all of the different actions available to a PC at a glance drastically reduces the mental load required to roleplay them effectively.

For dice rolls with preset difficulties (like a spellcasting check in Shadowdark RPG), the dice roll will show everyone at the table if it failed or succeeded, critically or not, meaning that nobody has to crunch the numbers and verify the character sheet.

I wouldn't play without Token Action HUD ever again.

### Tokenizer makes it easy to import images and create tokens from them

Tokenizer is a module that allows you to easily import images into Foundry and convert them into tokens.

Being able to do this entirely within Foundry is great. It reduces the time it takes to create these tokens and have them ready for use in your games ASAP.

It speeds up this process so much that if you're GMing a game and you need to create a token on the fly, Tokenizer will allow you to do that. 

### Image Hover puts token art front and center when you want it to be

The Image Hover module allows for hovering over a token to show the underlying art asset associated to it.

This helps with setting the scene and giving players zoomed-in images of the NPCs they're interacting with, enemies they're fighting, etc.

Don't play without it.

### Item Piles makes it easier to share loot between party members

Being able to drop items onto the map seems like it should be a core feature but it isn't --- The Item Piles module implements exactly this.

### Drag Ruler visually shows you how far a token can move in a turn

Drag Ruler visually shows you how far a token can move on the battlemap (green for walking, yellow for running or the equivalent in whatever system you're using).

In Foundry version 13, this will be a core feature of the VTT so this module will no longer be needed. But until that version releases, use this module!

## Tips and Tricks

### Set player permissions correctly

Each player should have the "owner" permission on their player character so that they can move their token around and modify their character sheet as needed during play.

If you'd like the players to share vision on the VTT, then each player should have the "limited" permission on everyone else's player character.

### Use satellite imagery for battlemaps

If you're playing a modern or something modern-like if you squint (like Palladium's Rifts) then you can use Google Earth Pro to generate at-scale battlemaps with realistic terrain and the tactical options it'll provide.

![](abandoned_factory_3.jpg)

I recommend exporting images at the highest resolution possible with a zoom level of 100m.

Once you have your image, all you have to do in Foundry is:

1. Create a new scene
2. Import the satellite image
3. Fuss around with the grid size number until the grid size makes it so that the 100m marker on the image lines up with your system's scale (whip out the ruler in Foundry and test it out!). I've found that a grid size between 20-30 seems to do the trick for Savage Worlds.

# Conclusion

I can't wait to dive into my next campaign, armed with all the lessons learned from running this one. Until next time, happy gaming!
