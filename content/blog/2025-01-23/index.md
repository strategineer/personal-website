Running a tabletop RPG campaign is always a learning experience. In this post, I'll share insights from my recent campaign, 'Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon', and lessons I learned as a GM --- some things I'd do differently next time!

<!--more-->

I ran the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon module using the Shadowdark RPG rules through the Foundry virtual tabletop over the course of 4 months between September 2024 and January 2025.

Now, I'll go over the lessons learned about each of these parts separately and then cover the insights gained from combining them all together for the campaign.

# Shadowdark RPG

## What's cool about the Shadowdark RPG system?

### Elegant and Concise Rules

I've read a bunch of different [OSR](#glossary) roleplaying rulebooks and out of all of those I chose Shadowdark for this campaign.

There's a lot to like about Shadowdark but its defining feature is that it's surprisingly **elegant** (given that it received the [Ennie Award for Best Game](https://ennie-awards.com/portfolio-item/2024-nominees-and-winners/) this shouldn't come as much of a surprise).

The rulebook is a masterpiece of design --- it's one of the best laid out rulebooks I've ever read and the rules are concise yet exceedingly clear.

### A Great OSR system for less experienced GMs

The Shadowdark RPG rulebook is incredibly helpful for GMs. It doesn't assume years of experience and provides clear instructions on how to run the game.

For example, how do you as the GM emphasise the danger and urgency of exploring a dark dank dungeon? A lot of OSR systems assume that you as the GM already know how to do this...

The Shadowdark RPG rules go out of their way to give GMs, who've never run an OSR game like this before, clear instructions on how to do exactly this.

Shadowdark's masterstroke is that 10 minutes of real-time represents 10 minutes in game-time (unless of course you've explicitly chosen to fast-forward through something).

And, every so often depending on how dangerous the area the PCs are in, you'll roll a d6 to check for a random encounter. On a 1, the PCs encounter something or someone.

This makes it clear for everyone at the table that spending real-time discussing what to do next or game-time searching under every tile in room for traps has the risk of a random encounter associated with it.

So, players are encouraged by the system to just do something which tends to be more fun than the alternative and keeps the game from becoming a slog.

While experienced GMs can solve these problems intuitively, Shadowdark RPG provides explicit guidance, which is incredibly helpful for newcomers. This ethos makes Shadowdark RPG stand out among its OSR peers.

I can't stress how amazingly concise and useful the rulebook is. But it's not a perfect fit for every OSR campaign you're going to run, including the one I ran.

## What's less cool about the Shadowdark RPG system?

### Supplemental classes aren't great

Some of the classes found in the Shadowdark official zines feel out of place, too strong or too weird compared to the classic Fighter/Rogue/Wizard/Cleric classes described in the core rulebook.

I would think carefully about allowing players to play any of these extra classes in future Shadowdark campaigns.

### Darkness rules are hard to implement

Also, the darkness rules in Shadowdark RPG didn't work as smoothly in practice as I expected them to. But I found that the game works fine even if you completely ignore them.

Having discussed the Shadowdark RPG system, now let's dive into the heart of my campaign --- the megadungeon itself.

# Maze of the Blue Medusa

## What's cool about the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon?

I read dozens of modules and megadungeons in preparation for running this campaign. I was looking for something special to give myself a solid foundation I needed to help me run my best campaign yet.

The Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon fit that bill perfectly --- it's cool, it's out there and it's also very me.

### Great Art combined with great writing

The Maze of the Blue Medusa is a product of a collaboration between Zak Sabbath and Patrick Stuart where Sabbath drew abstract, surreal room art to set the tone and would pass his art on to Stuart who would then write descriptions to breathe life into each area. This back-and-forth continued for several years producing the one-of-a-kind Maze of the Blue Medusa.

The Maze of the Blue Medusa isn't as funhousey as you might expect. The megadungeon is partitioned into several sections with common visual, literary and gameplay themes spread throughout.

### Awesome factions and unique NPCs that players will be dying to learn more about (or eat)

Several factions and the NPCs within them tie these disparate parts of the dungeon together helping you as the GM to make the dungeon come alive for your players.

There are hundreds of NPCs in the Maze of the Blue Medusa and any one of them could become a character that your players never forget for the rest of their lives because of how out there and unique most of them are.

### Interesting old school dungeon crawling challenges rewarding creative thinking

Generally, the rooms provide interesting challenges to overcome which is great for players interested in that classic old school dungeon crawling experience.

A defining feature of our campaign was the building and maintenance of a "Super Rake". It consisted of a ten-foot pole combined with the head of a rake which would be whipped out by the rogue Marlon whenever they thought that it would come in handy (which was often).

[EXAMPLE]

### Everything is weird

Despite providing ample classic dungeon crawl puzzles and combat experiences, the Maze of the Blue Medusa refuses to play any of it straight --- every NPC and every puzzle will be a little surreal, a little absurdist, a little mythical, a little weird and that's what got me interested in the Maze of the Blue Medusa in the first place.

For example, you can expect players to encounter psychic pigs, laughing liches, book-worms, robotic peacock butlers, cannibal critics (they eat artists), I could go on.

As long as your players are open-minded enough to play in an off-kilter fantasy environment then the Maze of the Blue Medusa will provide that in spades.

Now, let's discuss what makes the Maze of the Blue Medusa less than perfect.

## What's less cool about the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon?

### Some boring rooms

The Maze of the Blue Medusa is a big megadungeon and not all parts of it were created equally. Even though the quality of rooms is pretty high overall, there's a few that fall short.
 
An example of one is room 48 - Nui-Nga-Ma:

{{< spoiler >}}
A shell, 8' long, white, and patterned in green-white whorls the color of new leaves holding a layer of fresh unseasonal snow. Living in the shell is a large snail. Its limbs wave uncertainly like fingers seen through whiskey, somewhat transparent and indistinct.

Nui-Nga-Ma is not a true snail but a kind of golem created by Aelfadred The Glyph Witch (Gardens 58). She can hear anything the snail hears through a shell she keeps in her room. Likewise, Nui-Nga-Ma can hear anything that happens near the other shell.

**Niu-Nga-Ma**

AC 16, HD 4, ATK d8/d8
{{< /spoiler >}}

The way a GM could make this "encounter", featuring a really big snail / sentient communication device, interesting is beyond me.

There's definitely a few rooms in the Maze of the Blue Medusa like this that asked me to fill in the gaps way more than I was prepared for and as a result left me scratching my head in confusion (which is never a good position for a GM to find themselves in at the table).

I imagine that a more well-prepared and/or experienced GM would be able to read a room description like this and decide to replace it with something else on the fly. That wasn't the case for me.

### Some players won't vibe with the abstract surreal art

Another problem that we ran into is that the drawings are quite abstract and for visual players who want to see what NPCs look like you'll have to put in extra work to describe them in interesting ways and/or find less abstract images that aren't too far off the looks of the NPCs as described.

You'll have a hard time hard time doing that because a lot of these characters are unique looking to say the least and I think that losing that uniqueness would make the Maze of the Blue Medusa much less interesting.

### Interactions between factions are left for the GM to figure out

The Maze of the Blue Medusa could have done a better job of helping you run it with tips and ideas of how the various factions could be interacting with one another in interesting ways. The book could have been much more explicit about this in more places instead of leaving it up to the GM to make all of these connections on their own.

For example,

{{< spoiler >}}
Bringing the "Oku" (magical bird cosplayers essentially) who are natural rogues and thieves can come into conflict with the Cannibal Critics, mostly feral zombies who consume artists and hang out in the art gallery.

The book doesn't say this anywhere but I think it'd be better if it did.
{{< /spoiler >}}

So, the Maze of the Blue Medusa is great. The Shadowdark RPG system is great. Let's discuss the pros and cons of running the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon using the Shadowdark RPG system.

# Is Shadowdark RPG a good fit for running the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon?

The Shadowdark RPG seems to hinge on the constant struggle to light the path forward and avoid darkness --- at least it's marketed that way. In theory, this is a cool idea.

In practice, I wasn't able to accentuate the survival horror elements in the system due to my inexperience with Shadowdark and the large sections of the Maze of the Blue Medusa are well-lit and wouldn't work if they weren't.

Thankfully, the Shadowdark RPG system holds up even if you ignore all the darkness-related parts of the rules.

While I'd consider running a Shadowdark RPG campaign again, I wouldn't recommend it for running the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon without some caveats.

# What did I learn GMing this campaign?

## What did I learn GMing a megadungeon?

### Megadungeons aren't well suited for player-centric play 

I enjoy running and playing in roleplaying games where players have a lot of agency and megadungeons by design take up a lot of space at the table reducing player agency to some extent.

### Fixing your GMing mistakes is harder because players are going to be spending so much more time exploring the megadungeon 

If you make a mistake in terms of the way you've described a set of rooms then too bad because you won't be able to reset by having the PCs go into another dungeon next week. It's a megadungeon they'll be exploring it for dozens of sessions at minimum.

### Simulating factions and NPCs is harder because there's way more of them in a megadungeoen

Actions taken against NPC factions in one area of the dungeon should be taken into account by at least some of the other factions in the dungeon.

Megadungeons have a lot of factions in them making giving it and the NPCs in it verisimilitude more difficult because of the increased scale and scope of the dungeon.

All this to say, running a megadungeon is hard --- if I were to do it again, here's what I would do.

### Provide clear direction for players early on.

Give PCs a dated/incomplete map of the dungeon early on in their journey to give them an initial thrust towards something in the dungeon that interests them.

This would give them destinations to work their way to. Without some sort of direction, exploring a megadungeon can feel a little aimless and, at worst, boring.

No matter how interesting the encounters are, opening doors over and over again gets monotonous after a while unless the PCs have something they're trying to get to or a specific problem to solve.

### Establish a clear goal for the PCs to strive towards in the megadungeon

Whether it's rescuing an NPC, mapping out the dungeon, finding a particular artifact, etc. giving a clear goal for PCs to strive towards will get them moving in a direction instead of aimlessly wandering around a megadungeon hoping to stumble on treasure of some kind.

Trapping PCs in a megadungeon without an established goal (which is what I did in this campaign) wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be and I wouldn't do that again.

Even if you decide that the PCs goal is to find a way out of the dungeon unless the dungeon is specifically built around that goal I don't think it would work very well.

If your players aren't exploring the megadungeon and becoming invested in this vast space and the NPCs that inhabit it, what's the point of running a megadungeon?

### Never trap players without a purpose.

If PCs want to leave a dungeon they're trapped in (and they probably would unless you've established a reason for them to continue exploring it), they should be able to.

PCs risking life and limb because they *want* to is more interesting than doing the same because they're *forced* to.

### Give players opportunities to accelerate their travel through previously explored parts of the dungeon

Populate the megadungeon with more entrances, exits and ways for characters to travel through previously explored regions more quickly. 

I would give PCs more opportunities to find portals for entering/exiting parts of the dungeon, providing them with magical items to facilitate moving between certain places more quickly and maybe even having a quest line centered around setting up an in-dungeon taxi service of some kind. 

Megadungeons are BIG and navigating through previously explored parts of the dungeon over and over again can get tedious even if you re-populate them with roaming encounters of some kind.

My solutions above are a better alternative to fast-forwarding through travel of explored parts of the dungeon because that might set the expectation for players that the dungeon is more static and safe than it should be (safe is boring).

Factions within the dungeon can also make use of these entrance/exits allowing for a more dynamic dungeon and explaining away how certain recurring NPCs might find themselves meeting with the PCs over and over again despite the size of the dungeon.

### Populate the dungeon with other adventuring parties.

I would have at least one NPC with a similar overall power level to the PCs exploring the dungeon too.

This would be fun and make the dungeon a bit more dynamic. The PCs can collaborate with them or have a confrontation with them. Essentially, I think a gristled experienced and wise dungeon explorer would be a fun recurring NPC.

### Set an in-universe timer after which exploring the dungeon any longer will become untenable.

I would set an in-universe timer of some kind, communicate that to the players and PCs in some way and then after X sessions end with a bang.

For example, the dungeon of Titancomeon-man is prophesised to collapse in 30 days time, at that time the dungeon begins to collapse in on itself and the PCs might want to get some of the NPCs out of there, who do they pick?

This would provide a sense of urgency to the PCs's exploration of the dungeon and a clear stopping point. Even if the PCs haven't been able to comb through every single room they'll have to leave the dungeon for good.

## Give NPCs memorable voices (it's worth the effort!).

I've been roleplaying regularly since 2019 and in that time I've gotten so much better at it.

Despite roleplaying being a hobby I've been interested in for a decade and a half, the skills that I needed to have to enjoy it fully were challenging to acquire.

Putting in the time and effort to get better at every part of it has paid dividends in my roleplaying and outside of it.

I was so happy when I whipped out a voice for a "grumpy old man performing a shitty standup comedy routine" at a party I was attending and I got a really positive reaction for it.

I wouldn't have had the confidence or the skills to do that without forcing myself to do funny voices every week when GMing this campaign.

The Maze of the Blue Medusa features a ton of wild characters and trying, sometimes failing, to give all of them unique voices was a great learning experience and a ton of fun my players and I.

## Write session summaries to help you make the game world more reactive to players's actions 

Taking note of the big moments in each session gave me more opportunities than I would have had otherwise to weave previous events, player actions and reactions into subsequent sessions.

This helped a ton and I don't see myself running a game again without writing session summaries. They can only help and will help even more as I become a better, more well-rounded GM.

## Give players more opportunities to interact with their favorite NPCs.

If players really like a particular NPC, I should give them opportunities to interact with that NPC more rather than less (this is another thing that megadungeons make harder). The literal bookworm Germander was a pretty big success with my players --- in no small part due to the unhinged voice I used for him.

Sadly, he was stuck in his room being too big to fit through the doorway. This combined with the megadungeon being so big meant that the PCs weren't able to interact with him as much I or them would have liked to. In the last session of the campaign, I slimmed Germander down in order for him to exit from his reading nook/prison and follow the party but it was a little too late.

Another way I solved this problem was with Draco the Laughing Lich. He's a powerful lich who thinks life is meaningless and only cares about finding reasons to laugh. The party was able to make him laugh a bunch and so he gave them an Amulet of Slapstickification which doubled as a sort of bodycam/radio that he could use to communicate with the party without leaving his room. I thought that this was a fun way of allowing the party to interact with a powerful NPC more often without the NPC becoming a follower of some kind.

I should have also changed the random encounter table to include a "recurring NPC" entry to give me an extra kick in the ass to have a NPC show up again. Someone like Lady Crucem Capilli (a dragon/demon English empire-esque colonizer and artifact gatherer lady) would have been a great fit for this considering her inherent mobility (I liked the voice I had for her as well!).



# Foundry VTT

Foundry [VTT](#glossary) is **the** way to do tabletop roleplaying online no matter the complexity of the system. If someone's been generous enough to implement a roleplaying game system I'd like to run on Foundry VTT, then I will absolutely always play it that way moving forward. It's **that** good.

After years of suffering through Roll20 (a truly god-awful VTT) and building my own shitty VTT-adjacent tools on Discord or Google Sheets, I'm never going back. That's how good Foundry VTT is.

The only downside is that Foundry VTT requires a bit of setup and has a learning curve. However, the following tools can help ease the process.

## Essential Modules

No matter how well supported your chosen system is in Foundry VTT, the following modules will probably be useful for you:

### Quick Insert - Search Widget

Hitting control and the space bar to get instant drag-and-drop access to everything in your game including characters, items, NPCs, skills and being is a godsend.

This module facilitates character creation, inventory management and GMing generally.

### Dice Tray

Dice Tray provides an accessible and easy to use UI for you and your players to roll dice.

In most cases, using the modules below, especially [Token Action HUD Core](#token-action-hud-core), you'll rarely need to roll dice outside of the context of the pre-implemented dice rolls coming directly from your character sheet.

But when you do need to, perhaps because of a ruling you've made, using Dice Tray will be easier for most people instead of using the Foundry dice notation formulas in the chat.

### Token Action HUD Core

Foundry without Token Action HUD Core is great but a shell of what it can be. If the system you're playing with supports the Token Action HUD family of modules, you'll absolutely want to use it.

It puts a World of Warcraft-esque bar of actions at the top of your screen when you select a PC or NPC token. With Token Action HUD, you can make a stat roll, an ability/skill check (with all of the appropriate modifiers) for a particular character with just one click.

The crunchier your game is the more essential this module becomes. Showing all of the different actions available to a PC at a glance drastically reduces the mental load required to roleplay them effectively.

For dice rolls with preset difficulties (like a spellcasting check in Shadowdark RPG), when clicked the dice roll will show everyone at the table if it failed or succeeded, critically or not (nobody has to crunch the numbers and verify the character sheet, etc.). 

### Tokenizer

Tokenizer is a flexible module that allows you to take images and quickly convert them into tokens as fast as possible.

If you're GMing a game and need to come up with some tokens quickly, Tokenizer is a must.

### Image Hover

Simple but great, hovering over a token shows the underlying art associated to it which helps with setting the scene and giving visual players imagery to latch onto when your descriptions of NPCs aren't enough.

### Item Piles

Being able to drop items onto the map seems like it should be a core feature (but it isn't) --- The Item Piles module implements exactly this.

### Drag Ruler

Drag Ruler visually shows you how far a token can move on the battlemap (green for walking, yellow for running or the equivalent in whatever system you're using).

In Foundry version 13, this will be a core feature of the VTT so this module will no longer be needed. But until that version releases, use this module!

## Tips and Tricks

### Set player permissions correctly

Each player should have the "owner" permission on their player character so that they can move their token around and change their character sheet stats as they desire.

If you'd like the players to share vision on the VTT, then each player should have the "limited" permission on everyone else's player character.

### Use satellite imagery for battlemaps for modern and post-apocalyptic settings

If you're playing a modern or something modern-like if you squint (like Palladium's Rifts) then using Google Earth Pro, exporting images at the highest resolution possible with a zoom level of 100m allows for quickly generating at-scale battlemaps with realistic terrain and the tactical options they provide.

![](abandoned_factory_3.jpg)

Once you have your image, all you have to do in Foundry is:

1. Create a new scene
2. Import the satellite image
3. Fuss around with the grid size number until the grid size makes it so that the 100m marker on the image lines up with your system's scale (whip out the ruler in Foundry and test it out!). I've found that a grid size between 20-30 seems to do the trick for Savage Worlds.

# Conclusion

I can't wait to dive into my next campaign, armed with all the lessons learned from running this one. Until next time, happy gaming!
