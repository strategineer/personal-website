From September 15th 2024 until December 19th 2025, I ran an old school rennaissance tabletop roleplaying campaign I called the "Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon". I ran the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon module (see what I did there?), using the Shadowdark RPG rules through Foundry virtual tabletop.

For my own benefit and hopefully yours, I've written down as much as I can about how the campaign went and how I would've done it differently knowing what I know now.

# What's cool about the Shadowdark RPG rules?

I've read a bunch of different old school rennaissance (OSR) roleplaying core rulebooks and out of all of those I chose Shadowdark for this campaign.

There's a lot to like about Shadowdark but it's defining feature for me is that it's **elegant**.

The rulebook is a masterpiece of design, being one of the best laid out rulebooks I've ever read. The rules are simple and clear and doesn't do what a lot of OSR games tend to do which handwave away a bunch of information critical to actually playing a session of said game.

For example, how do you as the GM emphasise the danger and give the players a sense of urgency as they explore a dungeon? Most OSRs games assume that you as the GM already know how you like to do this and ask you to figure it.

Shadowdark goes out of its way to give GMs, who've never run an OSR like this before, clear instructions on how to do exactly this and in a very elegant way. Specifically, in Shadowdark, 10 minutes of real-time represents 10 minutes in the game (unless of course you've explicitly chosen to fast-forward through something). Every 10 minutes, you roll for a random encounter.

This means make it easy and clear to everyone at the table that spending 10 minutes in real-time discussing what to do next or searching under every tile in room for traps  has a risk of a random encounter attached to it. Thus, players are encouraged by the system to just do something instead which is likely to be more fun and keeps the game from the becoming an analysis paralysis slog.

An experienced GM can solve these potential problems without being told how to, but Shadowdark RPG tells you how to do it instead of assuming that you already know how to which most of these books do making Shadowdark stand out among its peers.

# What's NOT cool about the Shadowdark RPG rules?

Some of the extra classes found in the Shadowdark official zines feel either out of place, too strong or too weird compared to the classic Fighter/Rogue/Wizard/Cleric classes.

If I were to play another Shadowdark RPG campaign I would think harder about which of the extra classes to allow in the campaign and I wouldn't allow a player new to tabletop roleplaying to play the Chanter class because it is a little too weird.

# What's cool about the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon?

I read dozens of modules and megadungeons before landing on the Maze of the Blue Medusa. I was looking for something really special and cool so that I could give myself the hand I needed to run the best campaign I've ever run.

The Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon is really cool, it's really out there and it's also very me.

The Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon was made in collaboration between Zak Sabbath and Patrick Stuart. Sabbath would draw some rooms in this abstract and weird style. Then, Stuart would write room descriptions for the rooms that Sabbath drew. Sabbath would draw more rooms and then Stuart would write more room descriptions until the megadungeon was complete.

You'd think that this process would have lead to a more funhouse-style megadungeon where every room is completely unrelated to the others and contains a wacky encounter unlike anything else in the dungeon. Surpisingly, I found that the Maze of the Blue Medusa was less of a funhouse than I thought it would be.

The megadungeon is partitioned into several sections with common visual, literary and gameplay themes spread throughout them in a way that ties them together. Several factions and the NPCs within each section serve as a means of tying the disparate parts of the dungeon together and making it feel more cohesive and alive for the players.

There's hundreds of NPCs in this megadungeon and any one of them could become a character that your players never forget for the rest of their lives because of how out there and unique they all are.

Generally, the rooms provide interesting challenges and enigmas for PCs to overcome which is great for having players experience that classic old school dungeon crawling.

A defining feature of our campaign was the building and maintenance of a "Super Rake". It consisted of a ten-foot pole combined with the head of a rake which would be whipped out by the rogue whenever they thought that it would come in handy. That's the kind of dungeon crawling you'll find here and if that's what you're looking for, you'll get it in spades. 

Despite providing this classic dungeon crawling experience, the Maze of the Blue Medusa is also quite off-beat and weird with surreal and absurdist elements spread throughout it. If that sounds compelling to you then I can recommend it, as long as your players are open-minded enough to play in an off-kilter fantasy environment.

# What's NOT cool about the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon?

Some rooms are kind of boring and slow down the pace of the PCs exploration of the dungeon. If you can tell in advance which rooms are going to be like this then you can replace them or empty them out and have the party skip past them.

Another potential problem is that the drawings are quite abstract and for visual players who want to see what NPCs look like you'll have to put in extra work to describe them in interesting ways and or find less abstract images of things that look like them. You might have a hard time doing that though because a lot of these characters are pretty unique looking and losing that uniqueness would make the experience less interesting.

# Is the Shadowdark RPG a good fit for running the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon?

The Shadowdark RPG hinges on the constant struggle to light the path forward and avoid darkness. In theory, this is a cool idea. In practice, I wasn't able to make this interesting.

I think the designers also seem to have a problem making this part of their RPG interesting with their main recommendation being having enemies that threaten to and/or splash water onto the PCs.

Thankfully, the Shadowdark RPG system holds up even if you essentially remove the darkness parts of it.

Maze of the Blue Medusa is a weird and artsy megadungeon --- some parts of it clash with the Shadowdark RPG rules as written. Mainly, it features many sections that are fully lit and must be fully lit to make any sense. Turning off the lights throughout the whole dungeon wouldn't make much sense.

If I were to run the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon again, I would think about using a different OSR system but I would keep some of the Shadowdark RPG rules that are cool (like the real-time == game-time thing)

# What did I learn?

**Running megadungeons is hard but rewarding if done well.** I enjoy running and playing in roleplaying games where players have a lot of agency and I think that to a certain extent megadungeons run counter to that way of playing.

I could make running a megadungeon work but doing it right is harder than I thought it would be and correcting mistakes you've made is difficult because the PCs are by design stuck in this one place for multiple sessions.

If I were to run a megadungeon again, here's what I would do:

- I would provide the players with a dated/incomplete map of the dungeon early on in their journey (perhaps one of their quests would be to fill out the map?). This would give them destinations to work their way to. Without some sort of direction, exploring a megadungeon can feel a little aimless and, at worst, boring. No matter how interesting the encounters are, opening doors over and over again gets boring after a while unless the PCs have something they're trying to get to, a problem to solve.
- In a session 0, I would make sure that the PCs have a clear goal when going into the dungeon (rescuing an NPC? mapping out the dungeon? finding a particular artifact?). Being forcefully trapped in a dungeon without a goal isn't great unless you decide that escaping from the dungeon is the clear goal that the PCs have. Although, I don't think that would make much sense in most megadungeons because if you're not exploring it and becoming invested in the space and NPCs that live there, what's the point?
- Generally, I wouldn't trap PCs in the dungeon for longer than a session. If they want to leave, they should be able to. PCs risking life and limb because they *want* to is more interesting to me than doing the same because they're *forced* to. 
- I would provide more entrances, exits and "fast travel" points throughout the dungeon for PCs to discover. This would allow them to more quickly find their way around the dungeon which over time becomes harder to explore because the unexplored parts of it become further apart from each other. Fast-forwarding through already explored parts of the dungeon is another option here but you have to be careful to not train your players to feel completely safe travelling through these parts of the dungeon (safe is boring). The explored parts of the dungeon won't be as interesting to travel through again even if you repopulate them with NPCs. Factions within the dungeon can also make use of these entrance/exits allowing for a more dynamic dungeon and explaining away how certain recurring NPCs might find themselves meeting with the PCs over and over again despite the size of the dungeon.
- I would have at least one NPC with a similar overall power level to the PCs exploring the dungeon too. This would be fun and make the dungeon a bit more dynamic. The PCs can collaborate with them or have a confrontation with them. Essentially, I think a gristled experienced and wise dungeoneer would be a fun recurring NPC.
- I would set an in-universe timer of some kind, communicate that to the players and PCs in some way and then after X sessions end with a bang. For example, the dungeon of Titancomeon-man is prophesised to collapse in 30 days time, at that time the dungeon begins to collapse in on itself and the PCs might want to get some of the NPCs out of there, who do they pick? This would provide a sense of urgency to the PCs's exploration of the dungeon and a clear stopping point. Even if the PCs haven't been able to comb through every single room they'll have to leave the dungeon for good.

**Voicing NPCs is fun and adds a lot to the roleplaying experience.** I've been roleplaying regularly since 2019 and in that time I've gotten way better at it (progress has been slow but has accelerated in the last year or so). One of the ways in which I've gotten better is that I've become confident enough to voice my characters. The Maze of the Blue Medusa features a ton of wild characters and trying, sometimes failing, to give them unique voices was a great learning experience and fun. A more experienced GM would get a kick out of voicing all of the NPCs and doing a better job that I did.

**Session summaries are easy to write and really useful.** Taking note of the big moments in each session gave me more opportunities than I would have had otherwise to weave previous events, player actions and reactions into subsequent sessions. This helped a ton and I don't see myself running a game again without writing session summaries. They can only help and will help even more as I become a better more well-rounded GM.

**If players really like certain NPCs, always be ready to give them more opportunities to interact with them.** If players really like a particular NPC, I should give them opportunities to interact with that NPC more rather than less (this is another thing that megadungeons make harder). The literal bookworm Germander was a pretty big success with my players --- in no small part due to the unhinged voice I used for him. Sadly, he was stuck in his room being too big to fit through the doorway. This combined with the megadungeon being so big meant that the PCs weren't able to interact with him as much I or them would have liked to. In the last session of the campaign, I slimmed Germander down in order for him to exit from his reading nook/prison and follow the party but it was a little too late. Another way I solved this problem was with Draco the Laughing Lich. He's a powerful lich who thinks life is meaningless and only cares about finding reasons to laugh. The party was able to make him laugh a bunch and so he gave them an Amulet of Slapstickification which doubled as a sort of bodycam/radio that he could use to communicate with the party without leaving his room. I thought that this was a fun way of allowing the party to interact with a powerful NPC more often without the NPC becoming a follower of some kind. I should have also changed the random encounter table to include a "recurring NPC" entry to give me an extra kick in the ass to have a NPC show up again. Someone like Lady Crucem Capilli (a dragon/demon English empire-esque colonizer and artifact gatherer lady) would have been a great fit for this considering her inherent mobility (I liked the voice I had for her as well!).
