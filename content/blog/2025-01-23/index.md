Running a tabletop RPG campaign is always a learning experience. In this post, I'll share insights from my recent campaign, the Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon, and lessons I learned as a GM.

<!--more-->

I ran the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon using the Shadowdark RPG rules through the Foundry virtual tabletop tool between September 2024 and January 2025.

To start, I'll summarize the campaign, then I'll go over the lessons learned about each of the parts of the campaign individually and, finally, I'll cover insights gained from the campaign as a whole.

This is a really long post so I've tried to make it as skimmable as possible. Here's a table of contents with concise section headers for you to skim through at your leisure if you're short on time or me from the future trying to remember everything I learned running this campaign:

{{< toc >}}

# Campaign Summary

A wizard contracted a ragtag group of petty criminals, con artists and thieves (the PCs) to steal a painting. The PCs were pulled into it --- finding themselves trapped within the Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon.

The PCs explored the dungeon: solving puzzles, meeting friends and foes and everything in between.

Eventually, the PCs were given an opportunity to end the tyranny of the Blue Gorgon leading to a final encounter with the Blue Gorgon herself. The PCs gathered their many allies and brought them to the door of the Blue Gorgon's lair.

They found the Blue Gorgon, having read the writing on the wall, working through her fate and telling her Chameleon Women devotees to stand down.

The group found themselves collaborating with the Ashen Chanterelle who planned to rescue the Three Perfect Sisters from the labyrinth and rebuild the fallen Empire they once ruled, long since forgotten and buried by the world outside of the labyrinth.

The campaign ended as the ragtag group of scoundrels found themselves being promised positions of power within the administration of the soon-to-be rebuilt Empire led by the Chanterelle.

The end.

# Shadowdark RPG

## What's cool about Shadowdark RPG?

### Concise, efficient rules

There's a lot to like about Shadowdark but its defining feature is that it's surprisingly **elegant** (considering that it won the [Ennie Award for Best Game in 2024](https://ennie-awards.com/portfolio-item/2024-nominees-and-winners/) this shouldn't come as too much of a surprise).

The rulebook is a masterpiece of design --- it's one of the best laid out rulebooks I've read. The rules are concise, clear and comprehensive enough to allow new and experienced GMs to run fun Shadowdark games right ASAP.

### A great OSR system for less experienced GMs

The Shadowdark RPG rulebook is incredibly helpful for GMs. It doesn't assume years of experience and provides clear instructions on how to run the game.

For example, how do you as the GM emphasise the danger and urgency of exploring a dark dank dungeon? A lot of OSR systems assume that you as the GM already know how to do this.

The Shadowdark RPG rules go out of their way to give GMs, who've never run an OSR game like this before, guidance on how to do exactly this.

Shadowdark's masterstroke is that 10 minutes of real-time represents 10 minutes of game-time. And, depending on how dangerous the area the PCs are in, every so often you'll roll a d6 to check for a random encounter. On a 1, the PCs encounter something or someone.

This makes it clear for everyone at the table that spending real-time discussing what to do next or spending game-time searching under every tile in a room for traps brings the risk of a random encounter with it.

The system encourages players to just **do** something which tends to be more fun and helps keep the game from becoming a slog.

While experienced GMs can solve these problems intuitively, Shadowdark RPG provides explicit guidance, which is incredibly helpful for new GMs. This ethos makes Shadowdark RPG stand out among its many OSR peers.

I can't stress how amazingly concise and useful the rulebook is. Still, it won't be a perfect fit for every OSR campaign you're going to run.

## What's less cool about Shadowdark RPG?

### Supplemental classes are inconsistent

Some of the classes found in the Shadowdark official zines feel out of place, too strong or too weird compared to the classic Fighter/Rogue/Wizard/Cleric classes described in the core rulebook.

Although it didn't cause any serious problems in our campaign, it was an interesting challenge balancing combat encounters involving Brod, the tanky dwarven Pit Fighter with 30 HP, and Blotbug, the squishy goblin Witch with 5 HP.

I would suggest thinking carefully about allowing players to pick any of these extra classes in your campaign, especially for players new to roleplaying who'd be better served by playing a more iconic and simple class.

### Darkness rules are hard to use

The only thing that isn't elegant about Shadowdark is its handling of darkness and how little it helps you run a fun game where light is a resource that has to be managed.

Unless you can figure out how to fill your dungeons with water splashing enemies (like the book recommends) without making the dungeons feel more like waterparks, you're likely to run into the same problems I did with the darkness rules.

Thankfully, I found that the game works fine even if you mostly ignore these rules.

Having discussed Shadowdark, now let's dive into the heart of my campaign --- the megadungeon itself.

# Maze of the Blue Medusa

## What's cool about the Maze of the Blue Medusa?

I read dozens of modules in preparation for running this campaign. I was looking for something special to give myself the solid foundation I felt like I needed to help me run my best campaign yet.

The Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon fit that bill perfectly --- it's cool, it's out there and it's also very me.

### Great abstract, surreal art combined with evocative descriptions

The Maze of the Blue Medusa is a product of a collaboration between Zak Sabbath and Patrick Stuart. Sabbath drew abstract, surreal room art and would send his art to Stuart who would then write room descriptions based on the art. This back-and-forth continued for several years producing the one-of-a-kind Maze of the Blue Medusa.

Despite this process, the megadungeon isn't as funhousey as you might expect. The megadungeon is partitioned into sections with common visual, literary and gameplay themes which helps connect the rooms together into a cohesive whole.

### Weird, unique NPCs

Interesting factions and NPCs inhabit the dungeon. You can leverage these to further connect the disparate sections of the maze with each other and, in doing so, make the dungeon come alive for your players.

There are hundreds of NPCs in the Maze of the Blue Medusa and I can imagine any one of them becoming a character that your players never forget for the rest of their lives.

It's hard to understate how out there and unique most of these NPCs are.

### Everything is weird

Despite providing ample classic dungeon crawling puzzles and combat encounters, the Maze of the Blue Medusa refuses to play any of it straight --- every room, every NPC and every puzzle will be a little surreal, a little absurdist, a little mythical, a little weird and that's what got me interested in the Maze of the Blue Medusa in the first place.

It didn't disappoint. You can expect players to encounter psychic pigs, laughing liches, book-worms, robotic peacock butlers, cannibal critics (they eat artists), I could go on.

As long as your players are open-minded enough to play in this off-beat fantasy setting then the Maze of the Blue Medusa would be a great choice to include in your next OSR campaign.

It executes this weird vibe so well that even though the megadungeon isn't perfect --- what it does do well is so unique which more than makes up for its minor failings.

Let's discuss what makes the Maze of the Blue Medusa less than perfect.

## What's less cool about the Maze of the Blue Medusa?

### Some exceptionally boring rooms

The Maze of the Blue Medusa is a big megadungeon and not all parts of it were created equally. Overally, the quality of rooms is high, there's a few that fall short.
 
An example of one is room 48 - Nui-Nga-Ma:

{{< spoiler >}}
A shell, 8' long, white, and patterned in green-white whorls the color of new leaves holding a layer of fresh unseasonal snow. Living in the shell is a large snail. Its limbs wave uncertainly like fingers seen through whiskey, somewhat transparent and indistinct.

Nui-Nga-Ma is not a true snail but a kind of golem created by Aelfadred The Glyph Witch (Gardens 58). She can hear anything the snail hears through a shell she keeps in her room. Likewise, Nui-Nga-Ma can hear anything that happens near the other shell.

**Niu-Nga-Ma**

AC 16, HD 4, ATK d8/d8
{{< /spoiler >}}

The way a GM could make this "encounter" interesting is beyond me.

There's a few rooms in the Maze of the Blue Medusa that asked me to fill in the gaps way more than I was prepared for --- these rooms left me scratching my head in confusion (which is never a good position for a GM to find themselves in at the table).

I imagine that a more well-prepared and experienced GM would be able to read a questionable room description like this one and decide to replace it with something else on the fly. That wasn't the case for me most of the time.

### Some players won't vibe with the abstract surreal art

The room and NPC art in the Maze of the Blue Medusa tends to be quite abstract and doesn't often accurately convey what NPCs actually look like. This made it harder for the more visually-inclined players in the group to imagine themselves in these spaces and around these NPCs.

This put a little extra pressure on me to describe NPCs in more evocative ways and to find less abstract art to use as token art to represent these NPCs on the VTT.

This was challenging because of the large number of NPCs in the megadungeon and their unique looks that were impossible to find exact or even close matches for.

### Interactions between factions are mostly left for the GM to figure out

The Maze of the Blue Medusa book could have done a better job of helping you run it by providing more examples of how the factions could interact with one another in interesting ways.

The book could have been much more explicit about this in more places instead of leaving it mostly up to the GM to make all of these connections on their own.

For example,

{{< spoiler >}}
Bringing the "Oku" (magical bird cosplayers essentially) who are natural thieves and scavengers of knickknacks into conflict with the Cannibal Critics who are mostly feral zombies who consume artists and hang out in the art gallery would be a great idea.

Interactions like this aren't mentioned often in the book and I think it'd be better if it came up more often.
{{< /spoiler >}}

So, the Maze of the Blue Medusa is great. The Shadowdark RPG system is great. Let's discuss the challenges of running the Maze of the Blue Medusa using the Shadowdark RPG rules.

# Is Shadowdark RPG a good fit for running the Maze of the Blue Medusa?

Short answer, no.

The Shadowdark RPG seems to want you to focus on the player characters's struggle to light the path forward and avoid darkness at all costs.

Large sections of the Maze of the Blue Medusa are designed to be well-lit and wouldn't work at all if they weren't --- which made it hard to implement Shadowdark's "light as a resource" mechanics in the campaign. Thankfully, the Shadowdark RPG system holds up even if you mostly ignore the darkness parts of the rules.

While I'd consider running a Shadowdark RPG campaign again (maybe using [Patrick Stuart's Veins of the Earth sourcebook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35080398-veins-of-the-earth)?), I wouldn't recommend it for running the Maze of the Blue Medusa without the caveats above.

# What did I learn GMing this campaign?

## What did I learn GMing a megadungeon?

### Use an NPC checklist to ensure that NPCs are reacting appropriately to the PCs's actions

If I were to run a campaign with this many different NPCs in it again, I would write a list of all of the factions/NPCs that the PCs have met (and important ones that they haven't met), their current relationship with respect to the PCs and their goals.

I would review it after every session to ensure that I was prepared to make factions and NPCs in the world react appropriately to the actions of the player characters and, more generally, the events taking place in the game world. This would make the world come alive for players and add more weight to their actions within the game.

Walking through the checklist would also provide a great opportunity to come up with ideas on how I might bring these reactions into focus for players such that they're made aware that their actions in previous sessions have had consequences and that the world is responding to them.

For example, if the PCs piss off a faction, that faction might decide to put a bounty on the party. In this case, I'd write a [bang](/blog/2024-11-18/#bangs) where a gang of bounty hunters run into the party and I'd also prep a stat blocks for their leader and her mooks.

In a subsequent session, I'd bang this previously prepared bang and throw these bounty hunters at the party.

Ideally, over time, I'd be able to build a list of these "world reacting to the players" bangs and bring them into play at appropriate moments in subsequent sessions to create more complex narrative throughlines with the party juggling more than one faction/NPC relationship at a time.

### Provide clear direction for players early on

Without some sort of direction, exploring a megadungeon can feel a little aimless and, at worst, boring for the players.

One way of solving this problem would be to give the PCs an incomplete map of the dungeon early on in their journey to give them an initial thrust towards something in the dungeon that interests them.

No matter how interesting the encounters are, opening doors over and over again gets monotonous after a while unless the PCs have something they're trying to get to or a specific problem to solve.

### Establish a goal and reason for the PCs to explore the dungeon

Whether it's rescuing an NPC, mapping out the dungeon, finding a particular artifact, etc. giving a clear goal for PCs to strive towards will get them moving in a direction instead of aimlessly wandering around the dungeon hoping to stumble on treasure.

Sending PCs into a megadungeon without establishing a goal for them other than escaping from the dungeon (which is what I did in this campaign initially) wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be and I wouldn't do that again.

If PCs want to leave a dungeon they're trapped in (and they probably would unless you've established a reason for them to continue exploring it), they should be able to.

PCs risking life and limb because they **want** to is much more interesting than doing the same because they're **forced** to.

### End each session by confirming where the PCs are going next

Prepping for all the possible paths the players might take through the megadungeon felt like torture because I wasted so much time prepping NPCs and encounters that players never experienced.

Some of your prep time will be wasted no matter what you do to avoid this, especially when running a megadungeon, but getting a confirmation from players about where they're going to go next at the end of each session would have helped reduce this wasted prep time by quite a bit.

### Give means for players to accelerate their dungeon exploration

I would give PCs more opportunities to find portals for entering and exiting the dungeon in various places, provide them with transportation-related magical items and/or allow them to help set up an in-dungeon taxi service of some kind.

Megadungeons are BIG and navigating through previously explored parts of the dungeon over and over again can get tedious even if you re-populate these parts of the map with NPCs.

Factions within the dungeon can also make use of these additional entrances and exits which would make them more mobile and able to encounter PCs on a more regular basis throughout the dungeon.

### Blow the megadungeon up at a predetermined time

I would set an in-universe timer of some kind, communicate that to the players and PCs in some way and then after X sessions end with a bang.

For example, the PCs might learn from a soothsayer that the megadungeon they're exploring will collapse in 30 days time.

This would provide a sense of urgency to the party's exploration and a clear end to it. Even if the PCs haven't been able to comb through every single room they'll have to leave the dungeon for good.

I think that would be a more interesting experience than having the players comb through every single room in the megadungeon at a snail's pace, one by one --- potentially ending the campaign with a whimper instead of a bang.

## Give NPCs memorable voices

I've been roleplaying regularly since 2019 and in that time I've gotten much better at it.

Despite roleplaying being a hobby I've been interested in for a decade and a half, the skills that I needed to enjoy it fully were challenging to acquire.

Putting in the time and effort to get better at every part of it has paid dividends in my roleplaying and outside of it.

I was so happy when I whipped out a voice for a "grumpy old man performing a shitty standup comedy routine" at a party I was attending recently and I got a really positive reaction for it.

I wouldn't have had the confidence or the skills to do that without forcing myself to do funny voices every week when GMing this campaign.

The Maze of the Blue Medusa features a ton of wild characters and trying, sometimes failing, to give all of them unique voices was a great learning experience and a ton of fun for my players and I.

## Write session summaries to help you remember NPCs and player actions to bring up later

Taking note of the big moments in each session gave me more opportunities than I would have had otherwise to weave previous events, player actions and reactions into subsequent sessions.

This helped a ton and I don't see myself running a game again without writing session summaries ever again.

## Give players more opportunities to interact with their favorite NPCs

If players really like a particular NPC, I should be open to creating opportunities for them to interact with that NPC more.

The literal giant book-worm Germander was a big success with my players --- in no small part due to the unhinged voice I used for him.

Sadly, I kept him locked up in his room forcing my players to navigate back and forth through the megadungeon to talk to him.

This meant that the PCs weren't able to interact with him as much I or my players would have liked to. In the last session of the campaign, I slimmed Germander down in order for him to be able to exit his prison and follow the party on their last adventure but it was a little too late.

Another way I solved this problem later on in the campaign was with Draco the Laughing Lich. The party was able to make him laugh a bunch and so he gave them an Amulet of Slapstickification which doubled as a kind of bodycam that Draco could use to watch and comment on the party's actions as they made their way through the dungeon.

I should have also changed the random encounter table to include a "recurring NPC" entry to give myself an extra kick in the ass to have certain NPCs show up on a more regular basis.

An NPC like Lady Crucem Capilli (a dragon/demon English empire-esque colonizer lady) would have been a great fit for this considering her inherent mobility.

I liked the voice I came up with for her --- she could have been a fun recurring character and it's a shame I didn't bring her into play more often.

## Don't have amnesiac player characters

During the campaign, one character, the dwarf Brod, was running away from fascist Chameleon Women, he fought them off with the help of the party and joined the crew after the fight.

Brod couldn't remember anything about his past other than his recent escape from the Chameleon Women who were torturing him. Nobody at the table, myself included, had a clear idea of where Brod came from.

Having no prior relationship with any of the existing party members AND having no known past (we eventually filled that in later, but it was a little late) made it harder to roleplay Brod and for me to understand where Brod fit into the bigger picture of the campaign and within the party.

It wasn't that big of a deal but it's also something that I would never do quite like this again.

If I were to this differently today, I would have prompted everyone at the table to help us come up with a pre-existing relationship between Brod and somebody else in the party as soon as he entered the campaign.

For example, perhaps Brod could have been the long-lost adoptive relative of our artist/wizard Freeya. This would have acted as lubricant for fun roleplay for everyone at the table and would have set the stage for intrigue and fun narrative beats for the campaign later down the line.

The takeaway for me here is that everyone is discovering who their characters really are at the table through play. A complete blank slate like an amnesiac character is that much harder to roleplay effectively because of this.

If a player is deadset on playing an amnesiac character, I would make that sure by their second session, the character's gotten their memory back, everyone at the table knows exactly who they were and thus everyone should be ready to figure out who this character is going to become through play.

## Create random spell tables to help run enemy spellcasters in combat

Figuring out which spells an enemy spellcaster might have access to and would use in combat on the fly was challenging --- having tables that I could roll on to figure this out quickly would have made my life much easier.

Trying to run combat evocatively, fairly and quickly without losing player interest while trying to figure out which spells enemy spellcasters were going to cast proved to be much more challenging than I was expecting.

In emergencies, I would much rather roll on a random list of spells and pick a spell that might not be the perfect fit for a spellcaster to cast instead of slowing down combat to a crawl while I work my way through all the spells that the spellcaster might decide to cast in this moment.

# What were the biggest swings I'm most proud of in the campaign?

In running my Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon campaign, one of my goals was to try a bunch of stuff I'd never done before, to learn from the experience of failing to do all of it perfectly so I could bring that experience back to the table in my future roleplaying.

I found myself being, more than I ever have before, comfortable with taking big swings as a GM, knowing fully well that I was increasing the risk of missing. I decided to take that increased risk instead of playing it safe and learning much less from the experience as a result.

Here's a few of the bigger swings I took in this campaign and how they went:

## Running a high lethality survival horror-like campaign

I set out with this campaign to make my players fear for their characters's lives --- I wanted to make combat encounters tense and every combat decision made by players to feel like it mattered.

I think I mostly succeeded in running a high tension high lethality campaign even though no player characters died in regular combat encounters.

Almost every combat encounter the PCs found themselves in had one or more of the PCs drop to 0 HP, usually our 4 HP goblin witch Blotbug, who were put in a "downed but not out" state and found themselves a round or two away from dying more often than not.

To make these moments more thrilling than they would be otherwise, I "borrowed" the best rule from {{< book_url "Mothership 1E">}} and integrated it into the Shadowdark rules.

Whenever a player character would drop to 0 HP or below, I would roll a d4, adding the character's Constitution modifier to it. This produced a death timer which represented the number of rounds the character had left before they died permanently unless they were stabilized by an ally. I decided to make these death timers secret information like it's done in Mothership.

This made combat encounters universally tense. Almost every combat encounter had a PC getting downed and because the party didn't have a cleric, they had limited ways of stabilizing their allies without risk.

I **never** fudged the numbers with these death timers --- there was quite a few times that a PC, usually Blotbug, was one round away from dying but each time they were picked back up again just in time.

That said, the survival horror / inventory management part of the campaign that I hoping to deliver on was harder to make interesting that I thought it would be.

After the first few sessions, I reduced the emphasis on gathering torches and tracking food rations for resting because it wasn't adding much to the campaign.

Although, this mostly implied scarcity of resources early on in the campaign did encourage players to engage in cannibalism and the eating of various other sapient-adjacent beings that they wouldn't have done otherwise. And, this led to some interesting serendipitous and unexpected opportunities for fun roleplaying.

For example, the eating of a size-changing psychic pig led to Freeya gaining the ability to commune with the psychic pig within himself to gain information from NPCs.

This ability acted as a sort of social lubricant to enable him to connect with NPCs more easily and it provided me with ample opportunities to reveal fun context to the PCs about the labyrinth and the NPCs inhabiting it.

So, in this case, me trying and failing to run a campaign with a focus on survival horror and inventory management with scarce resources led to creative roleplaying opportunities for players and I that added a lot of spice to the campaign that wouldn't have been there otherwise.

## Running a megadungeon

I read carefully through hundreds of room descriptions and I was able to bring them and the NPCs in them to life at the table week after week. I've spent a lot of time in this post discussing how running megadungeons well is hard but I managed to do it it anyway.

I did the thing.

It wasn't perfect but tabletop roleplaying never is. The uncertainty, the chaos and the challenge are part of the fun and without them there wouldn't be a reason for me to roleplay in the first place.

## Giving NPCs unhinged voices

Before running this campaign, I'd never really tried to voice NPCs much differently from the way I speak normally. I'd put my tongue in my cheek or scrunch up my face to change my voice a bit but this wasn't something I focused on much.

With this campaign, I set out to go big with my voices and spend a lot of time trying to both speak in a voice unlike my own and come up with believable things that the NPC would say at the same time.

Maybe this kind of thing comes naturally for some people, but it didn't for me. I had to put in a bunch of work to get better at this skill. Thankfully, it paid off.

An example of this was my voice for Germander. Here's his description for context:

> Germander is a 15' long gray-pink worm with the most fucked up voice you can summon and features just this side of the uncanny valley, but is among the more agreeable creatures you’ll meet in the Maze.

When the party encountered Germander for the first time, I described his appearance and I unleashed the most unhinged voice I could come up with and it got a really positive reaction from my players.

Before the campaign started, I had told everyone that I would try and give unique voices to all the NPCs they would meet but, in that moment, I followed through and surprised them with my willingness to be ridiculous and fail repeatedly to be consistent with all these voices I came up with.

Germander's voice and his vibe were interesting enough for players that they spent most of the campaign with him acting as their main patron --- giving them more opportunities to interact with him, the PCs went on a quest to find more books for Germander to read.

**speaks in cowboy voice**: What can I say, partner? I must have done something right because it felt so good. I'd do it again in a heartbeat --- don't you forget it.

## Creating a crazy powerful but fun magical item for a PC to cause chaos with

Spending some time with family one day after one of our roleplaying sessions, I stumbled on a deck of Tarot cards (Travis McHenry's Occult Tarot specifically) that was demon-themed --- each card had a demon on it with a summary of the demon's vibe and their "powers".

After one particular session, players had requested that I give them more loot and spread the love around so that every player character got something relevant for them.

So, I put two and two together, confirming with Freeya's player that the item I had in mind for their character, a demon summoning deck, would be interesting.

They said yes. So, I crafted a combat encounter where an enemy Chameleon Woman mage failed to effectively use this demon summoning deck, dying in the process, leaving it to be picked up by Freeya after all the other fascists were dealt with.

Over the course of the campaign, Freeya made use of the deck over and over again and, eventually, learned how to use it more effectively reducing the chance of an uncooperative demon being summoned.

And, it turned out to be one of the funnest parts of the campaign for me to run. Figuring out on the fly how a particular demon would fight, how they influence battles in other ways, how they would sound and what they would say was a ton of fun for me and my players.

It had a big impact on the encounters it was used in and acted as a big levelling tool for the player characters to lean on --- without it, they would have found themselves almost powerless to contend with the stronger threats in the labyrinth.

For example, Freeya using the demonic tarot deck contributed to Blotbug's death by sacrificial ritual late in the campaign. Cult of the Shattered Moon cultists ambushed the party, began "moon dancing" and trying to sacrifice Blotbug (which they'd been trying to do since well before the start of the campaign).

In response, Freeya whipped out his deck and summoned Yuval, a dromadary demon really into making people become friends. One thing led to another and Yuval compelled both the PCs and cultists to become friends and collaborate with each other on the ritual sacrifice of Blotbug.

This series of events didn't come completely out of the blue. Blotbug's player requested that Blotbug be killed off a few minutes before this particular session started, so I scrambled to set up an encounter in which that was going to be likely to happen but not impossible to prevent.

I got lucky that the PCs rolled extremely poorly in this encounter making it much easier for me to kill off Blotbug as I was asked to do. I'm not quite sure what I would have done if the PCs had rolled really well here... I guess we'll never know.

Prior to this encounter, the demon summoning deck had always produced good results although I had tried to make it clear that no matter how much time Freeya spent trying to master the deck, using it was always going to be risky --- here, I was playing into expectations and tropes related to demon summoning in other forms of media.

And, so when the demon summoning went wrong and led to a bad outcome for Blotbug, my hope is that it landed, felt within reason of something that could have happened, and was fun to roleplay. I think that it mostly worked which was a happy accident for me considering how short the time I had to make these last minute changes to the session.

None of this would have happened if I didn't find this weird Tarot deck in real life, realize how cool it would be for a character in my campaign to use and put it in the campaign.

Although, the demon summoning Tarot deck was a such great item which had such a big impact on encounters in the last half of the campaign that I found myself failing to come up with ideas on what I could give other player characters that would be just as cool and impactful.

If I were to play another OSR campaign I would try to come up with an ultimate item for each player character ahead of time so that when I needed a cool item to give to specific player characters, I would have the items ready to go.

Those were my big swings and how they went, another big swing of mine was deciding to use the Foundry virtual tabletop tool as a GM for the first time. It went really well and I don't see myself doing much roleplaying online without it in the future --- it's just that good.

# Foundry VTT

Foundry VTT is **the** way to do tabletop roleplaying online. If someone's been generous enough to implement a roleplaying game system I'd like to run on Foundry VTT, then I will absolutely always play it that way moving forward. It's **that** good.

After years of suffering through Roll20 (a truly god-awful VTT) and building many of my own shitty VTT-adjacent tools on Discord or with Google Sheets, I'm never going back. That's how good Foundry VTT is.

Luckily for me, Shadowdark has great support for play through Foundry VTT.

The only downside is that Foundry VTT requires a bit of setup and has a bit of a learning curve no matter what roleplaying system you decide to use with it.

## Essential Modules

No matter how well supported your system of choice is in Foundry VTT, the following modules will probably be useful for you:

### Quick Insert gives you instant access to everything in your game

Hitting control and space bar to get instant drag-and-drop access to everything in your game including things like characters, tokens, items, NPCs, skills, etc. is a godsend.

This module facilitates character creation, inventory management and GMing generally to such an extent that I would never use Foundry without it.

### Dice Tray gives you easily rollable dice when you need them

Dice Tray provides an accessible and easy to use UI for you and your players to roll dice.

In most cases, using the modules below, especially [Token Action HUD](#token-action-hud), you'll rarely need to roll dice outside of the context of the pre-implemented dice rolls directly from your character sheet.

But when you do need to, perhaps because of a ruling you've made, using Dice Tray will be easier for most people than typing out dice notation formulas in the chat.

### Token Action HUD shows you all the actions your characters can do

Foundry without Token Action HUD is great but a shell of what it can be. If the system you're playing with supports the Token Action HUD family of modules, you'll absolutely want to use it.

It puts a World of Warcraft-esque action bar at the top of your screen whenever you select a character token.

With Token Action HUD, you can make a stat roll, an ability/skill check (with all of the appropriate modifiers) for a particular character with just one click.

The crunchier your game is the more essential this module becomes. Showing all of the different actions available to a character at a glance drastically reduces the mental load required to roleplay them effectively.

For dice rolls with preset difficulties (like a spellcasting check in Shadowdark RPG), the dice roll will show everyone at the table if it failed or succeeded, critically or not, meaning that nobody has to crunch the numbers and verify the character sheet to confirm that a given roll was succesful or not.

### Tokenizer makes it easy to import images and create tokens from them

Tokenizer is a module that allows you to easily import images into Foundry and convert them into tokens.

Being able to do this entirely within Foundry is great. It reduces the time it takes to create tokens and have them ready for use in your games ASAP.

Tokenizer makes this process so fast that you'll be able to create tokens on the fly if you need to. 

### Image Hover puts token art front and center when you want it to be

The Image Hover module allows for hovering over a token to show the underlying art asset associated to it.

This helps with setting the scene and giving players big images of the NPCs they're interacting with, enemies they're fighting, etc.

### Item Piles makes it easier to share loot between party members

Being able to drop items onto the map seems like it should be a core feature but it isn't --- the Item Piles module implements exactly this.

### Drag Ruler visually shows you how far a token can move in a turn

Drag Ruler visually shows you how far a token can move on the battlemap (green for walking, yellow for running or the equivalent in whatever system you're using).

In Foundry version 13, this will be a core feature of the VTT so this module will no longer be needed. But until that version releases, use this module!

## Tips and Tricks

### Set player permissions correctly

Each player should have the "owner" permission on their player character so that they can move their token around and modify their character sheet as needed during play.

If you'd like the players to share vision on the VTT, then each player should have the "limited" permission on everyone else's player character.

### Use satellite imagery for battlemaps

If you're playing a modern or something modern-like if you squint (like Palladium's Rifts) then you can use Google Earth Pro to generate at-scale battlemaps with realistic terrain and the tactical options it'll provide.

I recommend exporting images at the highest resolution possible with a zoom level of 100m.

Once you have your image, all you have to do in Foundry is:

1. Create a new scene.
2. Import the satellite image.
3. Fuss around with the grid size number until the grid size makes it so that the 100m marker on the image lines up with your system's scale (whip out the ruler in Foundry and test it out!).
  - A grid size between 20-30 seems to do the trick for Savage Worlds.

# Conclusion

I can't wait to dive into my next campaign, armed with all the lessons learned from running this one. Until next time, happy gaming!
