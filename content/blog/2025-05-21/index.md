Knave 2e implicit design

Tying magic items, called relics in Knave 2e, to gods, called patrons means that PCs have to devote themselves to serving the gods to gain their favor and boons, in the form of relics. 

Breaking these pacts with the gods, would lead to these objects of power, losing their power at best out at worst cursing those who try to make use of them. 

NB: Knave 2e would be great for running a campaign set in Mythical Ancient Greece.

Implicitly gods exist and their existence is common knowledge.

Explicitly, big cities are said to have shrines to all the gods. Perhaps some are less obvious than others but worshippers of a god can find a shrine for them.

This means that the system as written is open to dealing with issues of religious persecution but the problem underlying this conflict wouldn't be one of existence vs. nonexistence. 

As designed though, it seems that Knave 2e is more well suited for a setting where the gods are specific to a few domains (think Christian God vs. Mnemosyne, the Greek god of memory) and regular people tend to pray to one or another based on need rather than singular devotion. 

Certain gods might have a clerical class (priests, druids, death cultist leaders) who are more devoted and serve as more direct representation of the gods in the earthly realm

The system as written is packed with potential energy...

What is a god exactly? Are gods created or have they always existed? 

To talk about this further, let's discuss another big part of the Knave 2e ruleset. The magic system.

Magic spells are contained in spell books and alchemy can used to craft potions with magical effects. 

Although the rules as written don't explicitly state that magic and the world of the gods are separate, implicitly the stats do. With INT being used for all things magic and WIL (CHA?) being used for all things godly.

This brings us back to the subject of creation of gods.

Can mortals attain godhood? Perhaps through godly devotion to a particular good who then let's the mortal into "the club"?

Or maybe masters of the arcane arts can through study and devotion to their science, attain godhood as well?

That would be really fun and the Knave 2e rules as written would naturally bring these questions to the minds of GMs reading them.

In Ben Milton's other OSR TTRPG Maze Rats, I felt as though players interested in playing fighters or rogues were being left behind because of how cool the magic system in that game is. 

In Knave 2e, with the addition of relics, expansion of the magic system, players interested in magic

Subtly, there's been a de-emphasis on rogues as master of all trades characters due to the split bring DEX for melee attacks and WIS for ranged attacks. 

I think this is good because everyone in the party should be interested in loot, not just the rogues.

Fighters on the other hand can focus on being pack rats and using their array weapons perhaps doing. It's a little goofy but I think it's cool but it might take getting used to 

Also, it's unclear how this "weapon breaking to do more damage" system would interact with the relic system. Not at all? That's boring. Perhaps there can be martial-leaning patrons who can mean into this system? Lance of Returning, Sword of breaking.

But, Knave 2e is a classless system and so players can pick and choose which directions to develop their character in based on interest and opportunity rather than picking feats from an encyclopedia of 1000s.

Greek like Pantheon is good but PCs should choose their Patron instead of the other way around probably.
