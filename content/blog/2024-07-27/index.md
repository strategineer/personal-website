# A Short Hike

Great vibes, great music, great length (short as you can imagine).

# Solium Infernum

The idea is better in theory then in execution. The game need more time in the oven, despite that I spent ~100h playing the game.

# WARNO

The low(er) APM RTS for dads that I've been waiting for my entire life.

# Peaks of Yore

First person physics-based climbing game. This is not realistic in any way but it does nail certain elements of the real climbing experience that I got a bit of the same rush I get when I do real-life bouldering.

# Surmount

2D physics-based climbing game. I've got the speedrunning world record for this game so I guess I like it more than most.

# Mechabellum

Another dad-core strategy game.

# Lorelei and the Laser Eyes

Best melding of gameplay, visuals, sound design, music, story, etc. I played this year.

# Betrayal at Club Low

Goofy tabletop-esque heist game, essentially. Does what it says on the tin, and is very funny.

# Factorio Space Age

...

# Doom Eternal

... They've taken the core of Doom and made a AAA game out of it. What did you expect? It's good and feels like old Doom while being something else entirely at the same time. It's fun as hell.
