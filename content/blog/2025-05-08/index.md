Ursula K. Le Guin had a literary career spanning over 60 years. She was first published in 1959 at the age of 30 and continued writing the speculative fiction she's most known for until her passing on January 22, 2018.

Her most widely read works are her science fiction novels set in the Hainish universe, including The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed as well as her Earthsea series of fantasy novels.

But, she wrote many other novels that aren't as widely read that are just as deserving of praise and critical analysis such as her retelling of Virgil's the Aeneid from the perspective of the princess Lavinia, {{< book_url "Lavinia" >}}, her Philip K. Dick inspired take on the Daoist allegory of the Butterfly's Dream, {{< book_url "The Lathe Of Heaven">}}, and her series of loosely tied together fantasy novels, the Annals of the Western Shore.

Here, I'd like to talk about Le Guin's Annals of the Western Shore series (shortened to AotWS in the rest of this blog) because prior to seeing it surfaced on my remaindered book seller of choice I had never heard of it. I bought all three books in the series at steeply discounted prices and I've been slowly making my way through them since then.

Now, having read all three to completion I am scandalized by how good they are and how little they seem to have been read. I shed a tear comparing the over 342 000 ratings on Goodreads of Le Guin's A Wizard of Earthsea novel to the just over 11 000 ratings for the first novel in the Western Shore series, Gifts.

I can hazard a guess as to why AotWS seems to not have achieved the same level of popularity as Le Guin's other and much more widely known fantasy series of the Earthsea novels.

The book covers are god-awful, the title of the series is boring and the titles of the novels themselves are forgettable. Gifts, Voices, Powers... Really? All this speaks to a criminal negligence and mishandling of the publishing of these novels and it's a shame because the 

What do I like about these novels?

It's fantasy but it's written like science fiction, using the fantastical premise to explore issues relevant to our own not so fantastical lives.

These novels are marketeted as young adult novels although since their publishing, the use of the "young adult" genre has shifted dramatically. Broadly, the AotWS novels are coming of age stories featuring young characters growing up, understanding themselves and their place in the world they live in.

Similar to my feelings on {{< book_url "Gregor The Overlander" >}}, Le Guin doesn't dumb down her writing to cater to a younger audience, instead she fills these novels with characters that a younger audience will more easily empathise while exploring the complex anthropological themes Le Guin excels at writing about.

For example, the POV character in Powers, the third novel in the AotWS series, is a young man named Gavir who's been a slave for most of his life. He is described as a "Marsh" person who was taken from his home and enslaved by a noble family in the city of Etra.

Gavir's never known any other life than this one and so initially at least he doesn't question this life as being unjust or "wrong" but just as the way things are and have to be.

Gradually as Gavir grows up and learns more about the world around him, seeing his sister Sallo become a gift-girl and his growing frustration at being unable to pursue his noble love interest Sotur due to their differing positions in society, Gavir comes to the realization that this shit sucks ass and that it should stop.

In the first novel in the series, the young man Gry is living in a sparsely populated pastoral land ruled by families with special powers passed down through the generations.

Gry's family's power is the power of "unmaking", essentially they are able to unravel anything into their component parts, destroying it completely. This power can be used on people too and this fact is leveraged by the family to exert control over their land and the people forced to labour under the threat of this power.

Gry's father expects Gry to train in the use of this power and follow in his father's footsteps. The structure of this society is pushing both of them to lead lives that they are expected to lead.

Eventually, Gry rejects these expectations and this terrible power and chooses to become a "maker" of sorts by travelling the world, gathering stories from all parts of it, creating art and performing all over the world of the Western Shore.

In summary, the AotWS novels are deeply concerned with anthropolical, human behaviour, societies and how these are connected to one another and how these influence the behaviour of the people living inside of these societies.


That's cool as hell. I don't tend to enjoy fantasy novels broadly speaking especially when they are uncritical restoration fantasies or cookie cutter Tolkien ripoffs. Le Guin's fantasy especially her AotWS novels tends to be anything but that. Perhaps to these novels detriment and difficulty in marketing these novels to a mainstream audience.

I don't know. These novels read more like science fiction than what I usually associate with fantasy novels in that that the fantastical presuppositions are used as a lens to facilitate the exploration of deeply grounded human struggles that we can all relate to deep down but may not be open to exploring through a more grounded lens.

If you can look past all that, these books are great.
