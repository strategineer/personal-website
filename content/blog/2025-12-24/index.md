{{< book "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" >}}

{{< book "Candide ou l'Optimisme" >}}

In 2025, I read the book colloquially known as Candide twice. First, I read an English translation and then a heavily annotated French version of the text.

Candide (and {{< book_url "Don Quixote" >}} which I would have liked to have finished this year but getting through its 1000+ pages proved to be too much of a challenge) are both satires written in the early to mid 1600s that have withstood the test of time.

As a lifelong skeptic, both Candide and Don Quixote resonate with me because they succesfully portray the folly of believing in something that isn't true because it makes us feel better about ourselves.

False beliefs have real consequences and will continue to as long as people mistakenly cling to them.

The fact that Voltaire and Cervantes were both creating art speaking to this truth while entertaining their readers 4 centuries ago is impressive to say the least.

{{< book "The Seven Basic Plots" >}}

{{< book "Powers" >}}

Powers is the third entry in Ursula K. Le Guin's lesser known Annals of the Western Shore fantasy trilogy.

It's definitely more consistently well-written and interesting throughout than the Earthsea series, perhaps reflecting Le Guin's mastery of her craft in the last two decades of her career.
