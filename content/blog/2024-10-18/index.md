**What do you think is the deal with Abel (sic) and his inexplicable random acts of violence?**

[Spoilers for the Knight below]

{{< spoiler >}}

At the start of the Knight, but this is made clear(er) only in retrospect, Able is young and naive. He's a boy in a man's body but he doesn't really know who HE is, yet.

On some level, the Knight is a journey of self-actualization for Able. He's discovering who he is by doing what kids do. They do what the adults around them do and believe what they believe. In Able's case, early on in the Knight, he has a very brief encounter with a knight, Sir Ravd of Redhall.

Initially, this meeting isn't framed as being anything particularly notable for Able. Sir Ravd is a knight and the novel is called the Knight, so as a reader you might expect him to be important (you'd be right) but it's not presented as such. But by the end of novel it's made much more clear that Able's behaviour and beliefs throughout the text can be traced back to his brief meeting with Sir Ravd.

If you'd like to see evidence for this link between Able and Sir Ravd, here's [a really rough draft of essay on exactly this](https://strategineer.com/blog/2024-10-17/).

Trying to figure out why Able was acting the way he was acting throughout the story was a big part of the joy of reading the text for me but I can see how this experience could be frustrating. I was so enthralled the text that I felt willing to "go with it" and believe that Wolfe had a plan for Able.

Sir Ravd represents the foundation of who Able is, or wants to be, but then throughout the Wizard Knight as a whole, this relationship gets complicated and Able makes mistakes, recognizes them and changes his behaviour accordingly. He experienced a satisfying growth that you can see throughout the text which I also enjoyed.

**What is with the bizarre scene where he basically tortures the fire aelfs to swear off sutr while he continues doing exactly what sutr told him to do, completely blind to his hypocrisy**

As you know, the fantasy world of the Wizard Knight is a tiered univers

In the Knight, the archangel Micheal shows up and talks to Able. Micheal calls the Valfather and explains to Able that he should be able to do the same with Disiri.

instead of the other way around

I tried to keep this as concise as possible so let me know if you have any follow up questions!

If I'm remembering right, you dropped the Wizard at the first quarter of it right? I 100% understand dropping it there having read through that section myself. The pacing gets really weird, not to mention the || murder mystery ||...
