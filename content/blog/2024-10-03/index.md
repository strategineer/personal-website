Able of the High Heart is the POV character in Gene Wolfe's fantasy isekai novel The Wizard King. I think he's a great character and I'd like to explain why.

Let's start with the premise of the Wizard Knight for context and then I'll start talking about Able of the High Heart.

An American boy is Alice in Wonderland-ed into a fantasy world based on Arthurian myth, Norse and Christian theology. Soon after, he's physically transformed into an adult man who's jacked out of his mind but retains the young and impressionable mind of the young boy he really is on the inside. The story is framed as a letter written by the main character to his brother in America to explain everything that's happened to him since he left his home.

**Spoilers below for Gene Wolfe's novel The Knight, if the premise seems interesting you should read it!**

Able of the High Heart, which isn't a birth name but a name given to him by the Fate-like character he meets at the start of his journey, is this American boy. He's an interesting protagonist and let's talk about why.

Everything about Able of the High Heart's behaviour and thoughts stems from the discrepancy between his young mind and his adult body.

Able is forever changed due to his brief encounter with a knight named Sir Ravd of Redhall, early on in his journey (even before Able is physically transformed into an adult man). Although it's not framed that way at the time, it becomes clear throughout the first novel.

During his brief encounter with Sir Ravd, Able learns many things that deeply influence his beliefs and understanding of the world he's been transported to.

Able learns that being a knight isn't about money, a big horse, an accolade but it's about honor. 

{{< quote "48" >}}
“[...] It is honor, Able. A knight is a man who lives honorably and dies honorably, because he cares more for his honor than for his life. If his honor requires him to fight, he fights. He doesn’t count his foes or measure their strength, because those things don’t matter. They don’t affect his decision.”

The trees and the wind were so still then that I felt like the whole world was listening to him.

“In the same way, he acts honorably toward others, even when they do not act honorably toward him. His word is good, no matter to whom he gives it.”

Able learns that knights speak properly, specifically knights use "may" instead of "can" when appropriate.

{{< quote "47" >}}
I tried to clean myself off a little and told Ravd, “You can have your scield back if you want it.”

“May.” He had never stirred. “May governs permissions, gifts, and things of that sort. You speak too well, Able, to make such an elementary mistake.”

I nodded. I had not figured him out, and I was not sure I ever would.

Able learns that knights have followers, but perhaps not how to treat them well...

{{< quote "48" >}}
“Then he is not a knight, though he is someone I would like very much to count among my followers.”

I asked if he had many, because he had come into that forest alone, except for Svon.

“More than I wish, but not many who are as brave as this man you know.”

Able learns all about knighthood from Sir Ravd over a few days at most.

I went in, and the woman sat down on a little milking stool in front of Ravd.

He, seated on a short bench with a back, said, “Able, this is Brega. Because she is a woman, I permit her to sit. The men stand.”

Throughout the Knight, we'll see the influence of Sir Ravd's teaching

The thing we need to keep in mind about Sir Ravd of Redhall is that he dies soon after Able of the High Heart meets him. And thus, we're left to wonder whether his focus on honor above all else, leaving out activities like measuring the enemy forces before engaging them in combat might have led him to an early grave.

Thus, his being Able of the High Heart's role model for knighthood might not be such a good thing for Able. And, that makes him interesting.

"I am a hero"

"I am a knight"
.



I see Able's interactions with the world being informed by 2 main things

1. Once he's been Alice in Wonderland-ed into Mythgarthr, he meets with Sir Ravd, a knight. Pre-physical transformation Able is with Sir Ravd for just a short while and it's not written as a big deal for Able but meeting with Sir Ravd is gradually revealed to have been a really important experience for Able. It's made eventually that Able's entire conception of what a knight is comes from the little that Sir Ravd tells him about it.

Sir Ravd talks to Able about the following:
- Honor being the most important thing about being a knight
- A knight being a knight, mostly, due to their actions not their genealogy (Squire Svon is an example of this kind of archetype) 
- Using "may" instead of "can" (Able remembers this and corrects others like Sir Ravd corrected him)
- gathering followers
- staying at a bridge, waiting for another knight, beating them then taking all of their shit. 

All of these anectdotes, teachings and moments that Sir Ravd shows Able are internalised by Able and explain a lot of his behaviour moving forward

clear from his understanding of what a knight does, honor,  Sir Ravd is his role model and Able's understanding of what being a knight means is informed  it's clearly a moving through the rest of the book all of Able's actions are informed by
2. Able is faking it till he makes it constantly. His belief in himself seems to grant him power. I've noticed that Able is treated by the story as the main character. He has more than average Main Character Energy and I think that 

I've yet to read other people's thoughts on the novel so I don't know what other people think but 1 is made explicitely clear on multiple occasions , 2
