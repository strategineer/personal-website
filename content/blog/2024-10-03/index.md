Able of the High Heart is the POV character in Gene Wolfe's fantasy isekai tryptich The Wizard Knight. I loved the first novel of the set, the Knight, mainly because Able of the High Heart is such an interesting character.

In the following post, I'll describe the premise of the Wizard Knight, then I'll describe a formative encounter that Able has with the knight named Sir Ravd of Redhall early on in his journey and finally I'll discuss how this encounter shaped Able into the knight he is now (or wants to be) and why Able being this way is entertaining to read about.

# Premise of the Wizard Knight

In the Wizard Knight, an American boy is Alice in Wonderland-ed into a seven-tiered fantasy world (with each tier having dominion over the tier below it) based on Arthurian myth, Norse and Christian theology. Soon after, he's physically transformed into an adult man who's jacked out of his mind but retains the young and impressionable mind of the young boy he really is on the inside. The story is framed as a letter written by this boy to his brother in America explaining everything that's happened to him after he was transported to this other world.

**Spoilers below for Gene Wolfe's novel The Knight, if the premise seems interesting you should read it!**

# Able of the High Heart's Encounter with Sir Ravd of Redhall

Able of the High Heart, which isn't a birth name but a name given to him by the Fate-like character he meets at the start of his journey, is this displaced American boy.

Everything about Able of the High Heart's behaviour and thoughts stems from the discrepancy between his young mind and his adult body. The fact that he's partially amnesiac turns him into somewhat of an empty vessel for others characters to pour their very particular ideas about the world into.

One such character is Sir Ravd of Redhall, a knight that Able briefly encounters relatively early on in his journey in this other world. During this brief encounter with Sir Ravd, Able learns many things that deeply influence his beliefs and understanding of the world he's been transported to. However, it's only in retrospect that we as readers find out the scale of the impact this encounter had on Able's understanding of the hierarchal world he's found himself in and his place in it.

{{< quote "108" >}}
“I’m a knight,” I said; I always said that, because I knew I could never get people to believe me unless I believed it myself. “I’m Sir Able of the High Heart.”
{{< /quote >}}

Able absorbs a lot from his brief encounter with Sir Ravd, let's go over the most important bits of it.

Able learns from Sir Ravd that being a knight isn't about money, a big horse or the accolade (the ceremony whereby a knight is knight-ed).

Being a knight is about honor, above all else.

{{< quote "48" >}}
“[...] It is honor, Able. A knight is a man who lives honorably and dies honorably, because he cares more for his honor than for his life. If his honor requires him to fight, he fights. He doesn’t count his foes or measure their strength, because those things don’t matter. They don’t affect his decision.”

The trees and the wind were so still then that I felt like the whole world was listening to him.

“In the same way, he acts honorably toward others, even when they do not act honorably toward him. His word is good, no matter to whom he gives it.”
{{< /quote >}}

**The trees and the wind were so still then that I felt like the whole world was listening to him.**

It's lines like this that clue us in to how Able is perceiving Sir Ravd as a man he'd like to become, who's word are worth listening. Even though, we as readers can see that Sir Ravd kind of questionable in his behavior. He talks about honor but then he subjugates the people in this small town and enforces the will of his ruler...

[this is a bit of a sidenote...]

Able also learns from Sir Ravd that knights speak properly, specifically knights use "may" instead of "can" when appropriate.

{{< quote "47" >}}
I tried to clean myself off a little and told Ravd, “You can have your scield back if you want it.”

“May.” He had never stirred. “May governs permissions, gifts, and things of that sort. You speak too well, Able, to make such an elementary mistake.”

I nodded. I had not figured him out, and I was not sure I ever would.

Able learns from Sir Ravd that knights have followers, but he doesn't necessarily learn how to treat them well...

{{< quote "48" >}}
“Then he is not a knight, though he is someone I would like very much to count among my followers.”

I asked if he had many, because he had come into that forest alone, except for Svon.

“More than I wish, but not many who are as brave as this man you know.”
{{< /quote >}}

Able learns from Sir Ravd about chivalry, but also how to exert control over women and become an active part of the patriarchy.

{{< quote >}}
I went in, and the woman sat down on a little milking stool in front of Ravd.

He, seated on a short bench with a back, said, “Able, this is Brega. Because she is a woman, I permit her to sit. The men stand.”
{{< /quote >}}

PS: These few chapters with Sir Ravd of Redhall can be construed as a sort of veiled promise between Wolfe and the reader, telling the reader that Able is going to become like Sir Ravd or at least try to. The novel is called the Knight after all.

Able learns a lot from Sir Ravd over just a few days of being travelling with him. Throughout the rest of the text, we'll read some explicit evidence, and some less so, of Able's integration of Sir Ravd's teachings into his life and everything he does moving forward from there.

# Able of the High Heart echoing Sir Ravd throughout the Knight

Let's go over some examples of how Sir Ravd's teachings echo in Able of the High Heart's behaviour and thoughts throughout the rest of the Knight.

# Able of the High Heart - The Hero We Love

Now, it should be clear that Able's brief encounter with Sir Ravd impacted Able's worldview, his behaviour, his perception and understanding of the hierarchical world around him and the quests he sets for himself throughout the Knight.

This is interesting for a few reasons:
- sir ravd's encounter is not initially framed as being as important as it really is, it's only through reading the rest of the text that eventually you come to the realization that Able is emulating Sir Ravd in every way.
- Because of Sir Ravd just being some guy, really, and Able's very brief and skewed encounter with him this leads Able to becoming a single-minded (maybe even simple-minded) caricature of a hero, of a main character, of a knight who wants to be "good" but he's missing the forest for the trees     
- it makes for funnys conflicts and shit, clashes with main character energy



The thing we need to keep in mind about Sir Ravd of Redhall is that he dies soon after Able of the High Heart meets him. Leaving the reader to wonder whether the teachings of Sir Ravd, like not measuring the strength of enemy forces before engaging them in combat, might have led Sir Ravd to an early grave and might do the same for Able of the High Heart.

Thus, his being Able of the High Heart's role model of knighthood might not be such a good thing for Able. And, that's part of what makes him interesting.

Sir Ravd's questionable teachings about knighthood, honor and the patriarchy come into conflict with Able's main character energy (and plot armor) time and time again, and generate a lot of the tension, the humor and the excitement in the Wizard Knight.

In the immortal words of Sir Able of the High Heart:

"I am a hero"

"I am a knight"
 



I see Able's interactions with the world being informed by 2 main things

1. Once he's been Alice in Wonderland-ed into Mythgarthr, he meets with Sir Ravd, a knight. Pre-physical transformation Able is with Sir Ravd for just a short while and it's not written as a big deal for Able but meeting with Sir Ravd is gradually revealed to have been a really important experience for Able. It's made eventually that Able's entire conception of what a knight is comes from the little that Sir Ravd tells him about it.

Sir Ravd talks to Able about the following:
- Honor being the most important thing about being a knight
- A knight being a knight, mostly, due to their actions not their genealogy (Squire Svon is an example of this kind of archetype) 
- Using "may" instead of "can" (Able remembers this and corrects others like Sir Ravd corrected him)
- gathering followers
- staying at a bridge, waiting for another knight, beating them then taking all of their shit. 

All of these anectdotes, teachings and moments that Sir Ravd shows Able are internalised by Able and explain a lot of his behaviour moving forward

clear from his understanding of what a knight does, honor,  Sir Ravd is his role model and Able's understanding of what being a knight means is informed  it's clearly a moving through the rest of the book all of Able's actions are informed by
2. Able is faking it till he makes it constantly. His belief in himself seems to grant him power. I've noticed that Able is treated by the story as the main character. He has more than average Main Character Energy and I think that 

I've yet to read other people's thoughts on the novel so I don't know what other people think but 1 is made explicitly clear on multiple occasions , 2
