This website has existed in some form or another since Tuesday, October 10th 2017 (that was 7 years, 3 months and 11 days ago at the time of writing this)... It's been a long time coming, I've got an [about me page now](/about). Check it out!

Many many moons ago, I took a week off work-work and got to work on the website you're on right now.

It began as a glorified blog and a place to host my CV. It's changed over time, now it's become my [fully digital bookshelf](/books) containing all of the books I own with tooling to support importing new ones easily and to support exporting all of my notes on them as Goodreads reviews.

It's also home to many of my weird experiments like [my Egg pun-based breakfast restaurant name generator](/bin/eggstermination/), [my Marcus Aurelius' Meditations Explorer](/bin/meditations/) and [Wordler, my tool for cheating at Wordle that I only built to show people that the game is kind of shit](/bin/wordler/).

And, in the last year or so, I've started leveraging my website to host all of my tabletop roleplaying stuff like:
- one-pagers and session summaries for my tabletop roleplaying players --- [here's the page for my Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon campaign](/tabletop/campaigns/labyrinth-of-the-blue-gorgon/)
- [my homebrewed X-Mooks system based on the super hackable GLOG system that I'd like to run one day](/tabletop/xmooks/rules/). 

The site was initially built using the static website framework [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) but around two years ago I switched over to the much more flexible and efficient [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I was getting tired of waiting several minutes for Middleman to update my pages as I worked on them --- switching over to Hugo sped up page compilation times from several minutes to fractions of a second. This allowed for much quicker iteration times which helped me overhaul the look and feel of the website these past few years.

In all this time, I've never had an about page. This seems like a bit of an oversight considering how much sweat and tears I've poured into this little project of mine over the years.

So [I created one](/about).
