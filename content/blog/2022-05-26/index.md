I had made some minor changes to my website last week, I don't remember exactly what I was doing.

I was sitting there, waiting for my website to build.

Watching the clock tick away.

Comtemplating the reality that every second I spend waiting for my build to finish is a second that I'm never going to ge back.

_There's got to be a better way!_

Turns out there was. All of a sudden, I spent an entire weekend gutting my website, ripping out Middleman, the static website generator I was using, and replacing it with Hugo.

[WHAT IS A STATIC WEBSITE GENERATOR]

Why Hugo?

I wanted to speed up my build times and Hugo was sold to me as one of, if not, the fastest static website generator. It was claiming to be able to build gigantic websites in seconds and that's all I needed to hear to convince me to invest the time to execute the middleman and call up a guy named Hugo.

Along the way, I discovered many other desirable aspects of Hugo that might convince someone to start using it (like I did).

So here are some of the reasons why you should use Hugo:

- Hugo is opinionated, it doesn't allow you to use arbitrary code execution as a crutch (like Middleman, and create spaghetti code as a result).
- Hugo is "batteries included", meaning that it's likely to be able to do everything you want it to do right out of the box. For me, I was worried that it wouldn't be able to mimic the structure of the blog that I had with several different types of content (blog, recipe, random stuff), it was able to. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to easily compress the images I have but it was able to do it and very cleanly too.
- Hugo is fast. Generating my entire website takes 1.5s, this is incredible considering that it was was taking minutes to generate with Middleman. What's even more impressive and useful to me is that I'm able to make a change to website and see it appear almost instantly on the browser tab
- Hugo is flexible enough to allow you to do exactly what you want with it without giving you enough rope to hang yourself with.
