One of the dumbest things you can do when collaborating with others is to ignore them.

When I ask a co-worker a question by email or by chat, I expect that question to be answered, eventually when they get around to it. And, not ignored for the rest of eternity because, for whatever reason, they've decided that they would rather not answer the question.

Let's imagine a completely hypothetical scenario that has NEVER happened to me before. A coworker asks for some help with a problem. To be able to provide the right kind of help, I need to have some context.

Let's say we're dealing with AWS secrets.

To help myself get the context I need to provide the help they want, I might ask a question like: "Have you added a key to AWS before?". Depending on their answer, I can either show them how to add one or

I expect them to answer that question with a Yes or a No. If the answer is No, then

# Solutions

It's easy to complain about problems and not go through the extra effort of actually thinking of solutions for these problems, so let's try that.

Unfortunately, I have little control on the way others decide to behave in their everyday lives. Hopefully, writing this post is enough of a kick in the ass to get at least one person on the planet to understand how annoying it is when they choose to ignore or lie to someone.

But what can you do?

A few things.

The easiest solution to this problem is to talk to the person in question in person or over a conference call. I've found that people have a harder time ignoring you or lying to your face when it's done this way.

Also, it's important to frame your question in a way that makes it as easy as possible for the person on the other end to choose to answer it.

I tend to be direct when I speak (and when I write, or at I try to) because that's, usually but not always, the most effective way for me to communicate.

Sometimes, a more diplomatic approach leads to better results.

Instead of asking a very direct question like "Have you added a key to AWS before?", you can clarify the reasoning behind why you're asking the question to make them feel more comfortable with answering the question.

Like "Have you added a key to AWS before? If you haven't, I can teach you how to do it yourself! That'll come in handy :)"

As a closing thought, it's unlikely that people acting this way are doing so maliciously. They've just decided (consciously or unconsciously) that sometimes it's ok to ignore or lie to someone who's asking them a question. If there are people you know who do this, be gentle with them.
