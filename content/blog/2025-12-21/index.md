A list of freak games, in randomized order, released in 2025 that I played and enjoyed.

<!--more-->

This year I've decided to focus on highlighting "freak" games that most people haven't played because they're either too niche or too weird or both rather than games that everyone has already played (if you're curious to see what didn't make my freak list, see the [honourable mentions](#honourable-mentions) below). 

# Freak GOTY List

## [The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy-](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy)

![](hundred_line.jpg)

I've played half a dozen visual novels over the course of my gaming career, sinking hundreds of hours into this extremely niche genre.

The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- is a AA (AAA by visual novel standards IMO) maximalist visual novel directed by the creators of both the Zero Escape series and the Danganronpa series. As someone who's enjoyed both of these series in the past, I spent the whole year trying to avoid this game because of the truly egregious playtime required to beat it.

But the constant recommendations by sources I trust combined with my renewed interest in visual novels (see my [thoughts on CHAOS;HEAD NOAH below](#chaoshead-noah)) eventually wore me down enough to get me pick it up.

All visual novels are freak games but The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- might be one of the **freaky-est** ever made. 
 

## [Mosa Lina: Second Layer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477090/Mosa_Lina/)

![](mosa_lina.jpg)

The bite-sized immersive sim platformer that I fell in love with in 2023 doubled in size this year with a free update that doubled the number of tools, levels, bosses and music tracks in the game.

This combined with the coop mode that was added in 2024 cements Mosa Lina as one of the greatest games of all time and one of the **freaky-est**.

## [Q-Up](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3730790/QUP/)

![](q-up.jpg)

Made by the developer of Universal Paperclips, Q-UP is a high-concept satirical multiplayer strategy idle-adjacent game that tears down the often complained about topic of "balance" in matchmaking systems in games like DOTA and Overwatch.

Everything about Q-Up pops: the art, the UX, the mechanics, the sound effects, the music. If you're anything like me you will get hooked by its addictive nature which will leave you with a profound sense of emptiness and meaninglessness by the end of it.

And that's the point. Unlike games like Vampire Survivors, Balatro, Megabonk, Deep Rock Galactic Survivor (I could go on, the rise of gambling slop barely-games continues), Q-Up raises up its **freak** card proudly while pointing at these other games and making you feel like shit for playing them.

## [Earthion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597580/Earthion/)

![](earthion.jpg)

A Sega Genesis / Mega Drive shmup released in 2025. Everything about it sings.

What differentiates Earthion from other "throwback"-style games is that if Earthion had come out in the late 80s or early 90s when games like this were being developed and released, people would have *lost their fucking minds*, Sega's fall into obscurity and game publisher-dom would have been reversed and the course of history itself would have changed.

If the concept of Earthion doesn't scream **freak** then I don't who what would.

## [Baby Steps](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281040/Baby_Steps/)

![](baby_steps.jpg)

Made by the developers of Ape Out and QWOP, Baby Steps is a surreal physics-based open-zone platforming game.

Baby Steps is a different kind of "throwback" game in that it rejects extrinsic rewards entirely, instead encouraging you to gain the intrinsic reward through achieving mastery of its unconvential yet controls.

The only "reward" for exploring the game world in Baby Steps are cinematics often involving uncensored donkey dicks and for that reason alone, Baby Steps is a **freak** game.

## [Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178480/Shiren_the_Wanderer_The_Mystery_Dungeon_of_Serpentcoil_Island/)

![](shiren.jpg)

The word roguelike doesn't mean what it used to mean, and that's fine. But this change has forced the much nicher community to find another name for games that are actually like Rogue.

That name is: **[traditional roguelike](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/What_a_roguelike_is)**.

Hypothetically, if one were to look up traditional roguelike in a hypothetical gamer dictionary, they would find Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island mentioned as the first example.

As a roguelike fundementalist, I immediately fell in love with Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island because it is a hyper-condensed embodiment of everything that traditional roguelikes are meant to be. Packaged in a format that is both welcoming to new players while providing just as much depth, if not much more, than its brethren.

Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island is a **freak** game because it's designed to be someone's first traditional roguelike and, yet, who in their right mind would decide to get into traditional roguelikes in 2025?

You tell me. {{< spoiler >}}If you are a freak, [Caves of Qud](https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/) might also be a good place to start. Shiren and Caves of Qud are **very** different games though, so you might like one but hate the other and vice-versa.{{< /spoiler >}}

## [The Bazaar](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1617400/The_Bazaar/)

![](the_bazaar.jpg)

The Bazaar is impossible to describe accurately and succinctly because it is different enough from games that have come before it that comparisons aren't helpful.

Essentially, it is a asynchronous multiplayer roguelike deckbuilder autobattler with Heartstone aesthetics.

That's the best I can do for now. The Bazaar's uniqueness makes it a **freak** game.

## [Deadeye Deepfake Simulacrum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1545990/Deadeye_Deepfake_Simulacrum/)

![](deadeye.jpg)

Deadeye Deepfake Simulacrum is a top down action immersive sim in which you play a little guy who infiltrates into high-tech guarded facilities to achieve various objectives like hacking into the mainframe, eliminating everyone inside, etc.

Depending on how you've decided to kit your little guy out, you'll have access to a wide variety of extremely wacky abilities that will drastically change the way you tackle the obstacles the game throws at you.

Deadeye Deepfake Simulacrum is a **freak** game for many many reasons but especially because you can hack bullets so that turn around mid-air and hit the people who fired them.

## Freak games that didn't make the cut

### CHAOS;HEAD NOAH
![](chaos_head.jpg)

I got back into visual novels this year and CHAOS;HEAD NOAH was the one I chose to spend more than 30 hours playing after hearing about it at Otakuthon 2025.

I haven't played many visual novels because most of them aren't worth playing whether that's due to them being poorly written, being needlessly boring or being written for children.

CHAOS;HEAD NOAH feels like an exception to the rule. I wrote quite a bit of [spoilery notes on it here](/books/v22505/)
