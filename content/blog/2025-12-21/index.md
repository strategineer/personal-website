A list of **freak** games, in randomized order, released in 2025 that I played and enjoyed.

<!--more-->

This year I've decided to focus on highlighting **freak** games that most people haven't played because they're either too niche or too weird or both rather than games that everyone has already played (if you're curious to see what didn't make my **freak** list, see the [honourable mentions](#honourable-mentions) below). 

# **Freak** GOTY List

## [The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy-](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy)

![](hundred_line.jpg)

I've played half a dozen visual novels over the course of my gaming career, sinking hundreds of hours into this extremely niche genre.

The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- is a AA (AAA by visual novel standards IMO) maximalist visual novel directed by the creators of both the Zero Escape series and the Danganronpa series. As someone who's enjoyed both of these series in the past, I spent the whole year trying to avoid this game because of the truly egregious playtime required to beat it.

The constant bombardment of recommendations thrown my way combined with my renewed interest in visual novels I was afflicted with this year (see my [thoughts on CHAOS;HEAD NOAH below](#chaoshead-noah)) eventually wore me down enough to get me pick it up.

All visual novels are **freak** games but The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- might be one of the **freakiest** ever made.

## [Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178480/Shiren_the_Wanderer_The_Mystery_Dungeon_of_Serpentcoil_Island/)

![](shiren.jpg)

The word roguelike doesn't mean what it used to mean, and that's fine. But this change forced the much nicher community to find another name for games that are actually like Rogue.

That name is: **[traditional roguelike](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/What_a_roguelike_is)**.

Hypothetically, if one were to look up traditional roguelike in a hypothetical gamer dictionary, they would find Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island mentioned as the first example.

As a roguelike fundamentalist, I immediately fell in love with Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island because it is a hyper-condensed embodiment of everything that traditional roguelikes are meant to be. It is both welcoming to new players providing just as much depth, if not much more, than its modern peers.

Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island is a **freak** game because it's designed to be someone's first traditional roguelike and, yet, who in their right mind would decide to get into traditional roguelikes in 2025?

You tell me. {{< spoiler >}}If you are a **freak**, [Caves of Qud](https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/) might also be a good place to start. Shiren and Caves of Qud are **very** different games though, so you might like one but hate the other and vice-versa.{{< /spoiler >}}

## [Deadeye Deepfake Simulacrum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1545990/Deadeye_Deepfake_Simulacrum/)

![](deadeye.jpg)

Deadeye Deepfake Simulacrum is a top-down action immersive sim in which you play a little guy infiltrating into high-tech guarded facilities to achieve various objectives like hacking into the mainframe, eliminating everyone inside, etc.

Depending on how you've decided to kit your little guy out, you'll have access to a variety of wacky abilities that will determine the options you have access to when tackling the obstacles the game throws at you.

Deadeye Deepfake Simulacrum is a **freak** game because you can hack bullets so that they turn around mid-air and hit the people who fired them.

## [Earthion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597580/Earthion/)

![](earthion.jpg)

A Sega Genesis / Mega Drive shmup released in 2025 built to run on original hardware.

Everything about it sings.

What differentiates Earthion from other "throwback"-style games is that if Earthion had come out in the late 80s or early 90s when games like this were being developed and released, people would have *lost their fucking minds*, Sega's fall into obscurity and game publisher-dom would have been reversed and the course of history itself would have changed.

If the concept of Earthion doesn't scream **freak** then I don't what would.

## [Baby Steps](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281040/Baby_Steps/)

![](baby_steps.jpg)

Baby Steps is a surreal physics-based open-zone 3D platforming game made by the developers of Ape Out and QWOP.

Baby Steps rejects extrinsic rewards entirely and instead encourages you to gain the intrinsic reward through achieving mastery of its unconvential control scheme.

Exploring the game world constantly rewards you with graet cinematics often involving uncensored donkey dicks flopping around and for that reason alone, Baby Steps deserves to be considered a **freak** game.

## [Mosa Lina: Second Layer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477090/Mosa_Lina/)

![](mosa_lina.jpg)

The bite-sized immersive sim platformer that [I fell in love with in 2023](/blog/2024-07-01/#mosa-lina) doubled in size this year with the Second Layer update that doubled the number of tools, levels, bosses and music tracks in the game.

This combined with the coop mode that was added in 2024 cements Mosa Lina as one of the greatest games of all time and one of the **freakiest**.

## [Q-Up](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3730790/QUP/)

![](q-up.jpg)

Made by the developer of Universal Paperclips, Q-UP is a high-concept satirical multiplayer strategy idle-adjacent game that tears down the often complained about topic of "balance" in matchmaking systems in games like DOTA and Overwatch.

Everything about Q-Up pops: the art, the UX, the mechanics, the sound effects, the music. If you're anything like me, you'll get hooked by its addictiveness and by the time you finish the game you'll find yourself with a profound sense of emptiness, meaninglessness and shame for wasting your time playing it.

And that's the point.

Unlike games like Vampire Survivors, Balatro, Megabonk, Deep Rock Galactic Survivor (I could go on, the rise of *gambling slop barely-games* continues), Q-Up raises up its **freak** card proudly while pointing at these other games and making you feel like shit for playing them (as you should).

## [The Bazaar](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1617400/The_Bazaar/)

![](the_bazaar.jpg)

The Bazaar is hard to describe succinctly because it's different enough from the games that came before it that referring to them isn't very helpful.

It's an *asynchronous multiplayer roguelike autobattler deckbuilder* with Hearthstone aesthetics.

The boldness of the Bazaar's concept and its polish compared to the relatively few number of people who seem to know about it make the Bazaar an obvious contender for **freakiest** *asynchronous multiplayer roguelike autobattler deckbuilder* game of the year.

## [Eternal Strands](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/)

![](eternal_strands.jpg)

Woke (non-derogatory) Monster Hunter with an innovative and flexible magic system.

Dialogue that I actually cared about listening to involving characters that are written quite well.

Perhaps, the least **freaky** game on this list.

## [Atomfall](https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/)

![](atomfall.jpg)

Atomfall is a brit-core open-zone narrative-focused S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-like.

As a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. mark, Atomfall's post apocalyptic [Roadside Picnic-esque](/books/9781613743416/) Zone setting combined with my love for Rebellion Developments's work on the Sniper Elite and Zombie Army games immediately hooked me.

It executes on its weird premise about as effectively as you can imagine. I don't know who this game is for other than sickos like me and if that doesn't make Atomfall a **freak** game for **freaks** that I don't know what does.

## **Freak** games that didn't make the cut

### [CHAOS;HEAD NOAH](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961950/CHAOSHEAD_NOAH/)
![](chaos_head.jpg)

I got back into visual novels this year and CHAOS;HEAD NOAH was the one I chose to spend more than 30 hours playing after hearing about it at Otakuthon 2025.

I haven't played many visual novels because most of them aren't worth playing whether that's due to them being poorly written, being needlessly boring or being written for children.

CHAOS;HEAD NOAH feels like an exception to the rule. I wrote quite a bit of [spoilery notes on it here](/books/v22505/)
