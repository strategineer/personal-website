Investigating a pair of murders who's culprit may be a man or a robot, the Europol detective Gesicht meets with the only robot to have ever killed a human, Brau1589 (Robot Model HRS0288), to ask him about these recent murders.

Brau1589 is imprisoned, presumably indefinitely, for his impossible crime. He did so despite Robot AI, supposedly, preventing robots from killing humans. Brau1589 did what no robot was believed to be able to do.

Brau1589 lays trapped, splayed out with a spear piercing his midsection pinning him to a wall.

Brau1589 explains that all his captors would need to do to kill him would be to simply pull the spear out of him. Yet, they choose to keep him alive.

Brau1589's killing of a human marks him as an anomaly, but also something more.

Portrayed as he is, as well as is function within the story thus far, Brau1589 is clearly a reference to Prometheus.

As stated on Wikipedia, "In Greek mythology, Prometheus is a Titan responsible for creating or aiding humanity in its earliest days. He defied the Olympian gods by taking fire from them and giving it to humanity in the form of technology, knowledge and, more generally, civilization".[^1]

Prometheus was punished for having gone against the wishes of the Olympian gods. He was pinned by the gods to a tree and cursed to have an eagle eat his, regenerating, liver every day for the rest of his immortal life for his actions. Interestingly, in ancient Greece, according to Wikipedia, "the liver was thought to be the seat of human emotions".[^1]

I doubt that Brau1589 has anything like a liver inside of him but his ressemblace to Prometheus is uncanny.

This allusion to Prometheus becomes closer to a reference through Brau1589's words during his discussion with the detective Gesicht. The detective shows Brau1589 some photos of the crime scenes and asks him: "What do you think these horns mean?"

In reply, Brau1589 speaks about the gods of death. Specifically, Herne the Hunter from William Shakespeare's 1597 play The Merry Wives of Windsor, Hades from Greek mythology and the eponymous Pluto from Roman mythology.

This explicit reference to mythology primes us as viewers to start thinking about these mythic references explicitly. The Brau1589/Prometheus allusion being the most obvious one.

Brau1589 continues by spelling out his theory on who the next targets may be. The murdered (destroyed?) robot was Mont Blanc, a legendary robot "[built with] the best technologies the world had to offer" and "who can also be weapons of mass destruction". Seven such robots were built, Mont Blanc and Brau1589 among them, Brau1589 believes that the rest of these robots will be targeted next, himself included.

Brau1589 and the other legendary robots being god-like in their powers, the allusion to Prometheus becomes more and more clear.

If Brau1589 is an allusion to Prometheus, then what is the "fire" that he stole and who did he give it to?

Brau1589 and the other legendary robots are god-like but compared to Greek mythology, the roles have been seemingly reversed where in Pluto the humans have created the gods (legendary robots).

despite being godlike, the creator and created roles have been switched between the robots and the humans

1. Much like Prometheus, Brau1589 is both above humanity as a god-like being but also subservient to it, being both created by and imprisoned by humans.
2. If Brau1589 is an allusion to Prometheus, are the other legendary robots also allusions? 

Now that we've concluded

of the world's which Brau1589 equates to weapons of mass destruction. , The six remaining,  mentions that there are gods is a robot but is he also a god?


This shouldn't Of course, Pluto is 

are robots gods? maybe? Mont Blanc is likened to one

We can think of Brau1589 as being the harbinger of the capacity to murder within robotkind. It's clear that 

We can also think of Brau1589 as being a source of knowledge for the humans who have chosen to keep him alive for nefarious purposes 

danger of technology that is inherently evil such as nuclear weapons being stockpiled and kept just in case

craving knowledge of the outside world which is normally deprived from.

what is a robot , what is a human, what is the difference, why does it matter?

a 5min scene can be so latent with meaning and reference that seeing it, reconigzing it would give you a much different appreaciatiing of the source material

it's important not only to reference but also modify and leverage pre-existing things to talk about something new
