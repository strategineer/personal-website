Tabletop roleplaying works best when everyone at the table is fully invested in the world that the characters you're playing exist in.

Ideally, everyone at the table should be fully bought in to the idea of all of you roleplaying together.

Here's a few tips on getting your players to give a shit.

# Tip 1: get on the same page

It's unlikely that as soon as the first session starts, everyone will be on the same page on what the world looks like, what the people in it worry about and everything else.

No matter how much you prepare yourselves by reading books, or watching movies, or playing games as a reference.

Everyone at the table is going to have a different idea of the kind of world you're playing in.

And, that's ok.

Building your shared vision of the world together is a fun part of roleplaying.

As your characters perceive the world around them and change it based on their actions, you'll be bringing this imaginary world to life.

To make sure this whole thing runs smoothly, I recommend discussing with your players what kind of tone the game should have.

It doesn't matter what you decide to play, whether it's a goofy game about planning and executing heists that go terribly wrong or a game about superheroes trying to solve world hunger by killing all the billionaires and redistributing the wealth.

Anything is possible, as long as everyone is on the same page with respect to the kind of world you're going to be building together, you're going to have good time.

# Tip 2: pick something you already know

If you're new to the world of tabletop roleplaying, you should choose a setting that most of your players are familiar with to help your players get up and running as quickly as possible.

You might be new to roleplaying but you all have probably been exposed to a wide variety of media throughout your lives that you can use to ground yourselves in something familiar while learning something new.

Here's a tabletop role-playing games with settings that your group might be a good fit for (in no particular order):

If your group loves shows like Supernatural and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, then you might enjoy [Monster of the Week](https://evilhat.com/product/monster-of-the-week/) where you play as a group of monster hunters who seek out monsters causing havoc in the world and stop them from being a threat.

If your group loves Scott Lynch's The Lies of Locke Lamora book or the universe of the Dishonored video games, then you might enjoy [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel) where you play as a crew of daring scoundrels seeking their fortunes on the haunted streets of an industrial-fantasy city.

If your group loves Hong Kong action cinema, then you might enjoy [Feng Shui 2](https://www.atlas-games.com/product_tables/AG4020/) where you play as ragtag group of action movie archetypes who travel through time to four different key points in history (the Tang Dynasty, the Opium Wars era, contemporary Hong Kong, and the post-apocalyptic future) and, by doing so, save the world (probably).

If your group loves fantasy and wants to play something like DND, then you might enjoy [Dungeon World](https://dungeon-world.com/) where you play as a group of heroes venturing into the most dangerous corners of the land in search of gold and glory.

Whatever your group's interests are, you should be able to find a tabletop roleplaying game that is a perfect fit for you.


# Tip 3: yes and

Now, you've found some people to play with, you've chosen a system and setting that your players are interested in and maybe already know a bit about, what's next?

I recommend that you all leave your critic selves away from the table and become completely receptive to the ideas that the other players are bringing to the table.

This is "yes, and".

When the DM/GM or a player brings an idea to the table silence your inner critic and instead of shutting it down, accept it and throw your own ideas into the mix and together you'll build something completely unique.

Are there exceptions to this? Absolutely.

If you're not comfortable then speak up and discuss the issue as a group.

But you should lean heavily towards accepting the ideas brought forth and building on them.

The more each player can contribute to the narrative and play an active role in shaping the world, the more they'll be interested in the game and thus give a shit.
