I had a week off work last week. I prepared myself for the hours upon hours of time spent cuddling with the dog I was dog sitting by getting a bunch of novels to read.

These novels appear on the [2025 Tournament of Books Long List](https://www.tournamentofbooks.com/the-year-in-fiction-2024) and most were recommended by [Abigail Nussbaum](https://wrongquestions.blogspot.com/), a critic who's work I discovered recently and I've been enjoying.

Here's some thoughts about them.

{{< book "The Extinction of Irena Rey" >}}

The metafictional swing of The Extinction of Irena Rey piqued my interest and my expectations were more than met. Turns out that a story translated by a translator told from the POV of another translator with both characters directly involved in the story being told is exactly the kind of premise I'm really into.

In the Extinction of Irena Rey, Jennifer Croft slams a lot of big ideas onto the page for the reader to explore and think about. This seems to be common practice in the more "artsy" novels I've read but I was pleasantly surprised by both how interested I was in most of the themes in the text and how cohesively woven together they seemed to be.

NB: I wrote a [spoiler-free review](/books/9781639731701/) for this one if you're interested in reading more of my thoughts about it.

{{< book "The Husbands" >}}

Next I chose to read Holly Gramazio's The Husbands because I was looking for something a little lighter to read and the premise seemed like it had a lot of comedic potential.

I'm pleased to report that Holly Gramazio's the Husbands is the funniest novel I've ever read.

I was actually laughing out loud through it instead of what I usually do with "funny" books which is, at best, smile and smirk.

The protagonist and our POV character in the Husbands, Lauren, is very likeable because she's so funny whether we're reading through her dialogue with the husbands she finds herself with or we're reading through her internal monologue-ing throughout the novel.

Lauren's a gamer at heart and a really funny one at that --- truly a woman after my own heart. 

NB: I wrote a [spoilery review](/books/9780385699037/) for this one if you're interested in reading more of my thoughts about it.

{{< book "Orbital" >}}

I picked up Orbital because it's a small novel that I could knock out in a day and it came highly recommended.

Samantha Harvey's Orbital reminds me a lot of [Jose Saramago's work](/authors/jos√©-saramago/) in form because Samantha Harvey doesn't use any punctuation marks for dialog making the prose feel stream of consciousness-y. This choice combined with good writing makes me feel that much more closer to the POV character's thoughts than I would be otherwise.

Where Samantha Harvey's writing in Orbital differs from Saramago's in his work is in its content. Saramago is usually interested in making small changes to the way our world works and working out how those changes ripple out and affect people's lives while doing political/religious commentary throughout.

On the other hand, in Orbital, Samantha Harvey seems more interested in describing the world mostly as-it is (perhaps shifting the timeline forward a bit) and protraying multiple POVs to express the wide range of the human experience. Perhaps the world's got enough problems right now that there's no need to create new ones to then dissect on the page?

The unprecedented natural disaster, a big AF typhoon caused by climate change, in Orbital feels more like something that's already happening to us today that we're actively suffering from rather than a maneuver Saramago would make like "everybody on the planet is becoming blind" as some kind of metaphor for political ideology / faith gone wrong (see {{< book_url "Blindness" >}}).

In Orbital, Samantha Harvey doesn't appear to be as militantly atheist as Jose Saramago does in his work but the portrayal of Shaun makes me think that she is unlikely to be a believer.

I find it hard to believe (see what I did there?) that Shaun, as the only openly religious (Christian to be precise) astronaut on the crew, would go to space, watch as a typhoon rampages on the planet, killing uncountable numbers of people and, all of a sudden, start to subconsciously and consciously question his faith throughout all of the chapters dedicated to his POV.

That's his one character beat and I found it both hard to believe and a missed opportunity to portray a character who believes in a higher power in spite of their experience going space and gaining this new perspective on the planet and life as we know it.

One could argue that this new perspective Shaun has on the world could have a profound impact on his belief in God. But given that Orbital presents us with the POVs of six astronauts, I find it a shame that the only openly religious one's only character arc is one of his faith being shaken to the core by the act of going to space.

Using a natural disaster to "prove" that an all powerful and benevolent God can't exist is a common argument used in militant atheist spaces. Despite me agreeing with this argument in broad strokes, I find it hard to believe that Shaun wouldn't have encountered it already in his life and built up some kind of religious argument against it.

Basically, I think there's people out there who can believe in God and be astronauts and I would have liked to have seen that on the page even if I'm not a believer myself.

{{< book "Held" >}}

Each copy of Anne Michaels's Held should come with a contract granting the author the right to bounce you around like a human ping pong ball through time and space giving you shockingly evocative glimpses into people's lived experiences rippling through time, long after these people have passed away.

Held is about legacy, memory and, more broadly, how our ancestors live on through us.

The secret to its success as a novel is two-fold.

Firstly, Anne Michaels is a great poet and her writing in Held makes that clear. It's not poetry per-say, it's prose but if all literary writing exists along a scale between poetry and prose then Held's words would fall somewhere in the middle. Each section in Held is so short and so evocative in a way that reminds me of great poetry despite being prose.  

Secondly, the structure of novel allows Anne Michaels to "zoom in" on specific scenes displaced through time each of which has a lot of room physically on the page and fictionally to breathe and this gives space for the reader to step back and really contemplate them. Each section is dense with emotion in part because how much of both the past preceding it and future is left for the reader to guess at. Anne Michaels leaves a lot of room for the reader to imagine how the characters have come to be where they are now and how they got there. She solidifies parts of this as the novel goes on but doesn't reveal everything.

This makes Held similar to {{< book_url "Gilgamesh" >}} in that they're both inherently fragmentary. Of course, Held is fragmentary due to Anne Michaels choosing it to be and the Epic of Gilgamesh is because many parts of the story have been lost to time.

In both cases, a lot of room is left on the page leaving the reader's mind open to imagine the connective tissue that would bring all these disparate glimpses into the past together into a cohesive whole. This feels resonant with Held's theme of ancestoral legacies rippling through time which I think is really cool!

{{< book "The Ministry of Time" >}}

I didn't know anything about the Ministry of Time before picking it up and reading it other than it being in contention for the Best Novel of 2024 in certain circles (at least that's what I had understood prior to picking it up).

I "get" it. It's an ambitious novel that succeeds at combining multiple genres that usually don't mix in a way that *really* works.

Kaliane Bradley's The Ministry of Time is something like three parts romance, one part thriller, one part history fiction and one part science fiction. At its heart, its a romance. There's the constant longing and desire expressed by the protagonist and the "will they won't they" throughline that is used to prop up all the other genre tropes Bradley is masterfully juggling.

What surprised me most about The Ministry of Time was the tone. It's vulgar, it's funny, it's sarcastic all ways that feel natural to me but I don't often see in the novels I read.

Kaliane Bradley, and the narrator in The Ministry of Time, is a "passing" mixed race person raised by an immigrant mother displaced from her country and her people. This is relevant to my experience of reading through the novel because it comes up a lot in the text and because this is also my lived experience.

I can't say that Bradley's portrayal of this sexy AF sailor plucked straight from the Victorian era speaks to me but there's a lot in the Ministry of Time that does. And, it seems obvious to me that is partially because Bradley, the narrator and I all share this common history and how important it is to our understanding who we are, where we belong and how we interact with the world.

It's good, it's entertaining and I feel comfortable boosting the signal of the Ministry of Time in my own little way because of how well it portrays a lived experience of mine that I've never been able to put into words. Seeing parts of that lived experience expressed in this work that's doing so many other impressive warms my heart.

Although, I wonder what Bradley's next novel will look like considering that she's obviously self-inserted parts of herself (in a very fan fiction-y way) into the text, as the narrator. What will her next protagonist look like?
