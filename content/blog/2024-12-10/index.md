I had a week off work last week which I spent dog sitting. I prepared myself for the hours upon hours of time spent cuddling by getting a bunch of novels to read.

These novels appear on the [2025 Tournament of Books Long List](https://www.tournamentofbooks.com/the-year-in-fiction-2024) and most were recommended by [Abigail Nussbaum](https://wrongquestions.blogspot.com/), a critic who's work I discovered recently and I've been enjoying.   

{{< book "The Extinction of Irena Rey" >}}

The Extinction of Irena Rey piqued my interest due to its metafictional elements (a story translated by a translator told from the point of view of another translator, two characters directly involved in the story being told). It nails this premise and plays with it throughtout the novel in fun ways.

In the Extinction of Irena Rey, Jennifer Croft slams a lot of big ideas onto the page for the reader to explore and think about. This seems to be common practice in more "artsy" novels but I was pleasantly surprised by both how interested I was in most of the themes found within and how cohesively woven together they seemed to be.

NB: I wrote a spoiler-free review for this one if you're interested in reading more of my thoughts about it.

{{< book "The Husbands" >}}

Next I chose to read The Husbands because I was looking for something a little lighter to read and the premise seemed rife with potential for comedy.

I'm pleased to report that Holly Gramazio's the Husbands is the funniest novel I've ever read.

I was actually laughing out loud through it instead of what I usually do with funny books which is, at best, smile and smirk.

The protagonist and our POV character in the Husbands, Lauren, is very likeable because she's so funny whether we're reading through her dialogue with the various Husbands she finds herself with or we're through her internal monologue-ing throughout the novel.

She's a gamer and a really funny one at that --- truly a woman after my own heart. 

NB: I wrote a spoilery review for this one if you're interested in reading more of my thoughts about it.

{{< book "Orbital" >}}

I picked up Orbital by Samantha Harvey because it's a small novel that I could knock out in a day and it came highly recommended.

The way Orbital is written reminds me a lot of [Jose Saramago's work](/authors/jos√©-saramago/) in form because Samantha Harvey doesn't use any punctuation marks for dialog making the text feel stream of consciousness-y. This choice combined with good writing makes me feel that much more closer to the POV character's thoughts than I would be otherwise.

Where Samantha Harvey writing in Orbital differs from Saramago is in its content. Where Saramago is more interested making small changes to the way our world works and working out how those changes ripple out and affects people lives while doing political/religious commentary throughout.

Samantha Harvey, at least in Orbital the only work of hers I've read so far, is more interested in describing the world as-it is and creating POVs that she can use to express the wide range of human experience and present it to the reader. Perhaps the world's got enough problems right now that there's no need to create new ones to then dissect on the page?

In Orbital, Samantha Harvey doesn't appear to be as militantly atheist as Jose Saramago does in his work but the portrayal Shaun of makes me think that she probably is an atheist of some kind.

I find it hard to believe (see what I did there?) that Shaun, as the only openly religious (Christian to be precise) astronaut on the crew, would go to space, watch as a tornado rampages on the planet, killing uncountable numbers of people and, all of a sudden, start to subconsiously and consciously question his faith throughout all of the chapters dedicated to his POV.

That's his one character beat and I found it a little both hard to believe and a missed opportunity to portray a character who believes in a higher power in spite of their experience going space and gaining this new perspective on the planet and life as we know it.

One could argue that this new perspective Shaun has on the world could have a profound impact on his belief in God. But given that Orbital presents us with the POVs of six astronauts, I find it a shame that only openly religious one has his faith shaken by the act of going to space.

Using a natural disaster to "prove" that an all powerful and benevolent God can't exist is a common argument used in militant atheist spaces. Despite me agreeing with this argument in broad strokes, I find it hard to believe that Shaun wouldn't have encountered it already in his life and built up some kind of religious argument against it.

Basically, I think there's people out there who can believe in God and be astronauts and I would have liked to have seen that on the page even if I'm not a believer myself.

{{< book "Held" >}}

Each copy of Anne Michaels's Held should come with a contract granting the author the right to bounce you around like a human ping pong ball through time and space giving you shockingly evocative glimpses into people's lived experiences rippling through time, even long after the people involved have passed away.

Held is about legacy, memory and, more broadly, how our ancestors live on in us.

The secret to its success as a novel is two-fold.

Firstly, Anne Michaels is a great poet and her writing in Held makes that clear. It's not poetry per-say, it's prose but if literary writing exists along a scale between poetry and prose then Held's words would fall somewhere in the middle. Each section in Held is so short and so evocative in a way that reminds me of great poetry despite being prose.  

Secondly, the structure of novel allows Anne Michaels to "zoom in" on specific scenes and have a lot of room physically on the page but also fictionally within the text allowing for the reader to comtemplate these sections. Each one is dense with emotion due perhaps to the unstated history of how the characters came to be where they are now and how.

{{< book "The Ministry of Time" >}}

I didn't know anything about the Ministry of Time before picking it up and reading it other than it being in contention for the Best Novel of 2024 in certain circles (at least that's what I had understood prior to picking it up).

I "get" it. It's an ambitious novel that succeeds at combining multiple genres that usually don't mix in a way that *really* works.

Kaliane Bradley's The Ministry of Time is something like three parts romance, one part thriller, one part history fiction and one part science fiction. At its heart, its a romance. There's the constant longing and desire expressed by the protagonist and the "will they won't they" throughline that is used to prop up all the other genre tropes Bradley is masterfully juggling.

What surprised me most about The Ministry of Time was the tone. It's vulgar, it's funny, it's sarcastic all ways that feel natural to me but I don't often see in the novels I read.

Kaliane Bradley, and the narrator in The Ministry of Time, is a "passing" mixed race person raised by an immigrant mother displaced from her country and her people. This is relevant to my experience of reading through the novel because it comes up a lot in the text and because this is also my lived experience.

I can't say that Bradley's portrayal of this sexy AF sailor plucked straight from the Victorian era speaks to me but there's a lot in the Ministry of Time that does. And, it seems obvious to me that is partially because Bradley, the narrator and I all share this common history and how important it is to our understanding who we are, where we belong and how we interact with the world.

It's good, it's entertaining and I feel comfortable boosting the signal of the Ministry of Time in my own little way because of how well it portrays a lived experience of mine that I've never been able to put into words. Seeing parts of that lived experience expressed in this work that's doing so many other impressive warms my heart.

Although, I wonder what Bradley's next novel will look like considering that she's obviously self-inserted parts of herself (in a very fan fiction-y way) into the text, as the narrator. What will her next protagonist look like?
