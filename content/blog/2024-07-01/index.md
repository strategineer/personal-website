# Mosa Lina

{{< steam 2477090 >}}

Small indie game that packs a lot of punch, challenging and fun and very replayable.

# Jagged Alliance 3

{{< steam 1084160 >}}

Does what it says on the tin. A worthy modern successor to the old JA games.

Great strategic and tactical gameplay that provides fun challenges that can be solved in a variety of ways for dozens of hours

# Hitman

{{< steam 1659040 >}}

I played all the missions, I played a ton of the roguelike mode. Good shit.

# Fear and Hunger 1 and 2

{{< steam 1002300 >}}

{{< steam 2171440 >}}

An experience.

# Madcap Mosaic

{{< steam 1964330 >}}

A cool ASS roguelike.

# Heavenly bodies DLC

{{< steam 2391340 >}}

It's just great, there's no denying that.

# Baldur's Gate 3

{{< steam 1086940 >}}

A good ass CRPG. I wasn't as blown away by it as most, especially regarding the overarching narrative which I find to be a little uninteresting and negatively influenced all of the character interactions, but the game mechanics were solid and combat encounters were fun.

# Sifu

{{< steam 2138710 >}}

Good ass single player fighting game. It looks good, it plays well, visually it's stunning.

The game sort of just ends in a really anticlimactic way, unless you go for the "real" ending, which might be intentional. Even if it is meant to convey the idea there's nothing at the end of successfully executed revenge but a pile of corpses but it left me confused and questioning whether or not I had actually beaten the game (which isn't good).

# Factorio (with a ton of mods)

{{< steam 427520 >}}

230 hours later, Factorio is still an amazing game. I'm eagerly awaiting the DLC.

# Laika

{{< steam 1796220 >}}

Trials Metroidvania game with amazing music, art, everything? Sign me up.

I had such a deflating ending I felt like I either ran into some sort of bug but the journey was a joy.
