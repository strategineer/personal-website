# Mosa Lina

{{< steam 2477090 >}}

Indie puzzle platformer roguelite that packs a lot of punch, is challenging, fun and replayable.

# Jagged Alliance 3

{{< steam 1084160 >}}

A worthy modernized successor to the old Jagged Alliance games.

Great strategic and tactical gameplay that provides fun challenges that can be solved in a variety of ways for dozens of hours.

I played through the game twice and I can see myself coming back to it with different mercenaries.

# Hitman

{{< steam 1659040 >}}

I played through all of the missions which I've never done before. I played a ton of the new roguelite mode.

Hitman (2016) is the gift that keeps on giving. 

# Fear and Hunger 1 and 2

{{< steam 1002300 >}}

{{< steam 2171440 >}}

An experience like no other. It's hard to recommend an extremely weird run-based (?) Finish RPG maker game with a ton of extreme gore, violence and heinous content. 

BUT I had an interesting time with the Fear and Hunger series. If you're curious, I recommend starting with the second game and if you're really into it, go back and play the first game.

# Madcap Mosaic

{{< steam 1964330 >}}

A cool ASS roguelike deckbuilder where you don't draw cards from your deck. At the start of every encounter, The cards are placed randomly in a grid and you walk over cards, revealing them and activating their effects.

It's weird and unique and I like that. 

# Heavenly Bodies DLC

{{< steam 2391340 >}}

Heavenly Bodies is a great physics movement/platforming game and this DLC is bigger and better Heavenly Bodies. What more can you ask for?

# Baldur's Gate 3

{{< steam 1086940 >}}

A good ass CRPG. I wasn't as blown away by it as most were. The story makes a lot of concessions because of how interactive it is and my story wasn't told very well and wasn't too interesting even though I had a few interesting decisions I was able to make throughout. 

But the CRPG mechanics are solid and the combat encounters usually felt fun and well balanced. That's REALLY hard to achieve in a CRPG and that's what I'm most impressed by in Baldur's Gate 3.

# Sifu

{{< steam 2138710 >}}

Good ass single player fighting game. It looks good, it plays well, visually it's stunning.

The game sort of just ends in a really anticlimactic way, unless you go for the "real" ending, which might be intentional. Even if it is meant to convey the idea there's nothing at the end of successfully executed revenge but a pile of corpses but it left me confused and questioning whether or not I had actually beaten the game (which isn't good).

# Factorio (with a ton of mods)

{{< steam 427520 >}}

230 hours later, Factorio is still an amazing game. I'm eagerly awaiting the DLC.

# Laika

{{< steam 1796220 >}}

Trials Metroidvania game with amazing music, art, everything? Sign me up.

I had such a deflating ending I felt like I either ran into some sort of bug but the journey was a joy.
