A few weeks ago, I began running an old school rennaissance (mega)dungeon crawling tabletop roleplaying campaign using the Shadowdark RPG ruleset. It's proven to be the most successful of my attempts at GMing by far since my first and very poor attempt at it many many years ago (probably sometime around 2008-2009). Read on some more context on my roleplaying (or lack of) chops, otherwise [you can go straight to what I learned!](#what-i-learned).

I've always loved tabletop roleplaying ever since I first discovered it but throughout most of my life I participated in it sporadically. This changed in early 2019 when I found myself unemployed and with ample free time to explore hobbies and passions that I had neglected for many years, including tabletop roleplaying.

Since then I've been actively participating in tabletop roleplaying regularly and I've had the opportunity to run a few months-long campaigns with a few groups players in-person and online.

I've learned A LOT and I'd like to share what I've learned thus far in hopes that whoever reads this can avoid a lot of the pain and suffering that I and my players experienced as I learned the ropes of GMing.

# What I Learned

In no particular order, here's a list of lessons I learned throughout my recent experience of gming.

## use the right tool

- Foundry VTT
- shitty voices is funner than not, give them a unique gimmick or trick and pratice (if you can't do it, then describe the voice and speak normally)
- write a one-page for the campaign you'd like to run so everyone is on the same page (ref: D&D 5E - Michael E. Shea - Sly Flourish's The Lazy DM's Companion)
- Stars and Wishes
- So You Want to Be A Gamemaster by Justine Alexander (especially Bangs)
- use a good adventure/module/dungeon and build on it instead of doing everything from scratch
  - gives me the space to focus on building story/NPCs/encounters specifically for PCs instead of having to build everything
- write summaries for each session
  - even if you don't plan on using them for anything (like verbally summarizing the previous session, at the start of a session), it's useful because you can pick out interesting moments / events and then give yourself an opportunity to build on that in your prep / writing of subsequent bangs
- make PC decisions matter
  - it doesn't have to be big, but even the smallest recognition of a choice that a player made previously, adds to the roleplaying experience in a big way
- let players tell you what they want (Yes! and? But... [optional])
  - if they're interacting with a room, NPC in a particular way (for example, interacting with a trap as though it was a puzzle with a reward at the end), then acknowledge this within the game world and tweak it on the fly to support the PCs desired interaction if appropriate, otherwise let the players know that this way of interacting with the object isn't desirable and move them onto the next room/event
