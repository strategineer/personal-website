A few weeks ago, I began running an old school rennaissance (mega)dungeon crawling tabletop roleplaying campaign using the Shadowdark RPG ruleset. It's proven to be the most successful of my attempts at Gamemastering by far.

I've learned a lot about GMing since my first very poor attempt at it many many years ago (probably sometime around 2008-2009). Read on some more context on my roleplaying history, otherwise [you can go straight to what the lessons I learned!](#lessons-i-learned).

I've loved tabletop roleplaying forever but throughout most of my life I participated in it sporadically. This changed in early 2019 when I found myself unemployed and with ample free time to explore hobbies and passions that I had neglected for many years including tabletop roleplaying.

Since then I've been actively participating in tabletop roleplaying regularly and I've had the opportunity to run a few months-long campaigns with a few groups of players in-person and online. In that time, I've learned a lot and I'd like to share what I've learned in hopes that you can avoid a lot of the pain and suffering that I and my players experienced as I learned the ropes of GMing.

# Lessons I Learned

In no particular order, here's a list of lessons I learned throughout my recent experience of gming.

## Use Foundry VTT for hassle free snappy online roleplaying

The Foundry Virtual Tabletop is extremely cheap and might become the only way I'm willing to roleplay online in the future.

Foundry is really modular/ Setting it up just right took me a few hours but those hours were well spent because running sessions with a properly setup Foundry is an amazing hassle free experience. It just works. Everything is handled by the computer and so players can focus on roleplaying their characters instead of what dice they need to be rolling.

Tabletop roleplaying sessions with Foundry vs. without it are night and day. It's just so good. I'm going to have a really hard time convincing myself or my players to play online sessions without it.

## Bringing your characters to life with unique voices adds a lot to the roleplaying experience

I've always been curious about voice acting but I've never put in the time and effort needed to be good at it. Now that I've put in a bit of time and effort, I'm still not very good at it yet...

But even so, with my most recent campaign I made a commitment to myself, to give each NPC a unique vocal quirk/sound even if I'm not an expert at it (yet). My players seem to get a kick out of me doing this despite my relative inexperience.

When roleplaying online, the only way for players to know if the GM is speaking to them or embodying a character is by their voice. And so, when playing online it becomes that much more useful for a GM to voice their NPCs.

It's hard but I'm getting better at it every session and thus far even me flailing about is adding to the roleplaying experience for everyone involved, myself included.

Does this always work? No, and it turns out that praticing a voice ahead of time and perfectly re-creating it live for your players are two very different skills.

In the worst case, if get some performance anxiety and I'm unable to call forth a particular voice then instead of fumbling through it anyway I describe the voice to the players and then speak normally.

It turns out that both improving dialogue while speaking in a different voice, is quite challenging but the only way to learn is to try and being afraid of failure in this specific context isn't helpful in the longterm. 

## Write a one-pager for the one-shot or campaign you're planning to run

Before the first session of the my current campaign, I wrote a [one-page document](/tabletop/osr/labyrinth_of_the_blue_gorgon/#one-pager) describing everything I thought my players needed to know about the campaign that I wanted run. It included information like: the campaign's premise and flavor, the unique parts of the campaign, the details that would help players creating their characters and potential content warnings.


Writing this document helped me understand exactly what kind of campaign I wanted to run and forced me to express this in a concise way. This document was also an effective recruiting and hype tool because I was able to use it to both recruit players and get players that were already interested excited about the specifics of the campaign I wanted to run.

Out of all the campaigns I'v run, the characters my players created were top notch and a great fit for the campaign. It seems like though the one-pager combined with the next lesson I learned (see below) both helped my players create great characters.

Refer to page 10 of Sly Flourish's The Lazy DM's Companion by Michael E. Shea for more details on this.

## Force players to think about relationships between their characters and the world during character creation

Some tabletop roleplaying systems enforce this kind of relationship building as a core part of the character creation process but not all of them do. Even if I'm using a system that doesn't explicitly call for this (like the Shadowdark RPG rules for example), in the future I'll likely do it anyway because it's so useful.

Each player character starting off with a pre-existing relationship with at least one other player character as well as one NPC provides a solid foundation for roleplay from the get go. The pre-existing relationship with another player character can inform the roleplay between these two characters and pre-existing relationship with an NPC can both inform the goals this character might have as well as provide an important NPC that as a GM you can use as a piece of the puzzle.

These relationships tie the PCs together and grounds them in the reality of the game world. As the GM, you can use these relationships as the foundation for further integrating these characters in the world.

For example, Blotbug the goblin witch has a relationship to the Cult of the Shattered Moon who tried to ritually sacrifice him to their Dark God. He barely escaped with his life.

Is the Cult of the Shattered Moon still after him? If so, why? Why did they try to sacrifice him in particular? How has this event affected him? etc.

## Use the Stars and Wishes system to encourage a per-session constructive feedback loop that helps you GM better sessions for your players

The Stars and Wishes system ([described in more detail here](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/stars-and-wishes)) essentially forces players at the end of a session to provide positive and constructive feedback to other the GM and other players about the session.

Prior to starting my most recent campaign, I committed myself to trying this system as a way of making providing regular feedback an integral part of the roleplaying experience. I want to create an environment in which providing this feedback is the norm and not the exception to the rule, so that I could feel more confident that I'm providing the best roleplaying experience for my players that I can.

Considering how much effort goes into the GMing process, I think that forcing players to spend a few minutes each session is a very minor ask especially considering the potential benefit of this feedback including much higher player engagement and choice in the subsequent sessions. 

Without a system like this in-place, players have to go out of their way to provide feedback and thus they'll actively discouraged from doing so. The Stars and Wishes system serves as a way of making the act of providing regular feedback the social norm and discouraging players from not doing so.

I'm giving ample opportunity to players to speak up about their thoughts and feelings about the sessions so that if I'm making GMing choices that rub them the wrong way then the ball is in their court to tell me about it. Or, if the players have ideas about how they as players can do a better job playing the game then we have time for discussing these ideas and puttting them in-place.

For example, if one player is noticing that the group is having a hard time deciding where to go next, the GM and players can come up with a solution for this problem together (like assigning a leadership role to one PC and what they say goes).

This creates a feedback loop that is really helpful for me as a GM because it ensures that your players are given ample opportunity to say what's working for them and what isn't so that you can change subsequent sessions accordingly and be confident that you're all having as much fun as possible.

A **Star** is simply a positive comment on one part of session, this can be another player's roleplaying, a voiced NPC, this can be a fun combat encounter, etc.

A **Wish** is simply something that the player wants for the next session, this can be something meta like wanting the group to have a leader to speed up the process of deciding where the party goes next or a story beat that they want their character to nail or if the party wants to put a spotlight on a particular character.

This system is simple but it's crazy how effective it is in both making me confident that as a group we're optimizing for fun and every session is building on the previous one in a way that everybody likes.

## Bangs

This is a great book with a bunch of cool stuff in it but the best thing are bangs. ...

A **bang** is a scene/moment that you've come up with and you know that you want to have your PCs have. This could be something like meeting a new NPC

Because the tabletop roleplaying experience tends to be rather improvisiontal and reactive based on what your players decide to do, you have to still be able to prep these **bangs** and insert them ad-hoc at the right time.

Refer to *So You Want to Be A Gamemaster* by Justine Alexander for more info on Bangs (just reading this text levelled up my GMing ability ten-fold, at least it feels like it)

## Find a good adventure/module/dungeon and run WITH it

Using good source material as a foundation for my campaign has allowed me to spend all of my creative energy on character-focused story moments instead of forcing myself to build everything from scratch every week.

On a bad week, when I'm low on ideas I can always fallback on running the module (in my case, the megadungeon) as-is. The extensive pre-campaign prep I did in searching for the perfect module for my group and the extensive pre-session zero prep I did has paid off tremendously because I know that I can always fallback on a solid foundation that will provide a better than average experience for my players even without extensive pre-session prep.

NB: Knowing the module inside and out helps with improving cool things on the fly as well.

## Write session summaries (even if you don't plan on sharing them)

The process of writing post-session summaries has helped me recognize and me remember all the notable, cool, interesting moments and decisions players make during a session. This process makes it much easier for me to come up with ideas and [bangs](#bangs) to insert into subsequent sessions.

In the campaign I'm playing now, at the start of each session I verbally summarize the previous session's summary and that seems to be both appreciated by at least some of my players as well as helps with getting players back into the appropriate roleplaying headspace by setting the scene and letting them take the wheel after that.

In previous campaigns, I'd try to write down important moments during each session but in practice I found that running the session and being a notetaker was too much for my small brain to handle. For whatever reason, after the session is over I've found it much easier to write down a summary...

## Make PC decisions matter

If players choose to react a certain way to an NPC or an encounter, remember this ([maybe write session summaries to help you remember](#write-session-summaries-even-if-you-dont-plan-on-sharing-them)) and, if appropriate, find a way to acknowledge this decision they made by providing an in-universe reaction to it.

How do other NPCs in the world react to the PCs now that they've done X? The PCs have gone out of their way to poke the beast?

This will make the world come alive in way that it wouldn't have otherwise. You don't need to simulate the whole world all at once, that would be insane, but if you can take note of the actions of PCs and how those actions will change the world in ways that the PCs can see (eventually) this will make the world much more interesting to play in than it would be otherwise because your players know that their actions matter and will have an impact on the world.

## Yes! And? But...

Yes, and-ing is a popular technique from the world of improv that a lot of people know about. Essentially, your response to an idea presented by a player should ideally be "Yes!" followed by the "And?" which is the world's reaction to the player choice that builds on their idea instead of shutting it down.

It's all about taking the ideas that your players present you with during a session and building on them constructively. This helps include everybody 

These ideas can extend beyond the limit of their character's decisions with the game. The more I can include players in the collaborative storytelling process the more invested they'll become in the story, because they've contributed to it.

In the context of tabletop roleplaying games, sometimes a player wants to do something completely out of whack with the world you're trying to build. This should happen rarely and more and more rarely over time as you and your players better understand the rules of the world you're in.

But if it does happen, feel free saying "No" but make to explain why and do everything you can to avoid saying "No". Because it will discourage your players from coming up with ideas that interest them moving forward.

## Secret Death Timers

Most games have death timers so that players that are downed can be picked up by their allies if they get to them in time. If you're playing a high lethality game, keeping the number of rounds a downed PC has before they die a secret can ratchet up the tension for the players at the table and makes for much more tense and memorable close calls.

If the death timer were to be public information, even if only the downed player knew the number, this would lessen the tension considerably.

The only potential problem with doing this, is that the GM is the only person at the table who knows the death timer and especially if PCs haven't died yet, players might feel as though the GM is keeping the players in the dark in order to save characters instead of killing them...

I stole this rule from the Mothership RPG rules and I'm likely to house rule it when playing with other high lethality systems because it's amazing.
