A few weeks ago, I began running an old school rennaissance (mega)dungeon crawling tabletop roleplaying campaign using the Shadowdark RPG ruleset. It's proven to be the most successful of my attempts at GMing by far since my first and very poor attempt at it many many years ago (probably sometime around 2008-2009). Read on some more context on my roleplaying (or lack of) chops, otherwise [you can go straight to what I learned!](#what-i-learned).

I've always loved tabletop roleplaying ever since I first discovered it but throughout most of my life I participated in it sporadically. This changed in early 2019 when I found myself unemployed and with ample free time to explore hobbies and passions that I had neglected for many years, including tabletop roleplaying.

Since then I've been actively participating in tabletop roleplaying regularly and I've had the opportunity to run a few months-long campaigns with a few groups players in-person and online.

I've learned A LOT and I'd like to share what I've learned thus far in hopes that whoever reads this can avoid a lot of the pain and suffering that I and my players experienced as I learned the ropes of GMing.

# What I Learned

In no particular order, here's a list of lessons I learned throughout my recent experience of gming.

## Use Foundry VTT for hassle free snappy online roleplaying

The Foundry virtual tabletop is cheap and it, will, after a few hours of setup allow you to play your favorite tabletop roleplaying game online with little to no hassle.

Playing with it vs. without it is like night and day. Completely different and I know that I'm going to have a really hard time convince myself or my players to have sessions online without using Foundry VTT.

## Bring your characters to life with voices

At the minimum, give each NPC that speaks a particular vocal/verbal (or gestural if you're playing in person) gimmick that players can associate with the character so they can remember the character more easily when they show up again.

Worst case, if get some performance anxiety and I'm unable to call forth a particular voice then instead of fumbling through it I describe the voice to the players then speak normally.

## Write a one-pager for the one-shot or campaign you're planning to run

When GMing a one-shot or a campaign, it's important for you to make sure that you and all of your players are on the same page with respect to what kind of one-shot or campaign you're planning to run.

Your players need to know what kind of characters


This document will be handy for gathering players as well.

Refer to page 10 of Sly Flourish's The Lazy DM's Companion by Michael E. Shea for more details on this.

## Enforce basic relationships during character creation

No matter what system you're using, ensure that each PC has at least one relationship with another PC in the party as well as one relationship to someone in the world.

This helps tie the PCs together and ground them in the setting of the game. As the GM, you can use these relationships as the foundation for further integrting these characters in the world.

For example, Blotbug the goblin witch has a relationship to the Cult of the Shattered Moon who tried to ritually sacrifice him to their Dark God. He barely escaped with his life.

Is the Cult of the Shattered Moon still after him? If so, why? Why did they try to sacrifice him in particular? How has this event affected him? etc.

## Use the Stars and Wishes system to encourage a per-session constructive feedback loop that helps you GM better sessions for your players

The Stars and Wishes system ([described in more detail here](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/stars-and-wishes)) essentially forces players at the end of a session to provide positive and constructive feedback to other the GM and other players about the session. This creates a feedback loop that is extremely helpful as a GM because it ensures that your players are given ample opportunity to say what's working for them and what isn't so that you can change subsequent sessions accordingly and be confident that you're all having as much fun as possible.

A **Star** is simply a positive comment on one part of session, this can be another player's roleplaying, a voiced NPC, this can be a fun combat encounter, etc.

A **Wish** is simply something that the player wants for the next session, this can be something meta like wanting the group to have a leader to speed up the process of deciding where the party goes next or a story beat that they want their character to nail or if the party wants to put a spotlight on a particular character.

This system is simple but it's crazy how effective it is in both making me confident that as a group we're optimizing for fun and every session is building on the previous one in a way that everybody likes.

## Bangs

This is a great book with a bunch of cool stuff in it but the best thing are bangs. ...

A **bang** is a scene/moment that you've come up with and you know that you want to have your PCs have. This could be something like meeting a new NPC

Because the tabletop roleplaying experience tends to be rather improvisiontal and reactive based on what your players decide to do, you have to still be able to prep these **bangs** and insert them ad-hoc at the right time.

Refer to *So You Want to Be A Gamemaster* by Justine Alexander for more info on Bangs (just reading this text levelled up my GMing ability ten-fold, at least it feels like it)

## Find a good adventure/module/dungeon and run WITH it

Using good source material as a foundation for my campaign has allowed me to spend all of my creative energy on character-focused story moments instead of forcing myself to build everything from scratch every week.

On a bad week, when I'm low on ideas I can always fallback on running the module (in my case, the megadungeon) as-is. The extensive pre-campaign prep I did in searching for the perfect module for my group and the extensive pre-session zero prep I did has paid off tremendously because I know that I can always fallback on a solid foundation that will provide a better than average experience for my players even without extensive pre-session prep.

NB: Knowing the module inside and out helps with improving cool things on the fly as well.

## Write session summaries (even if you don't plan on sharing them)

The process of writing post-session summaries has helped me recognize and me remember all the notable, cool, interesting moments and decisions players make during a session. This process makes it much easier for me to come up with ideas and [bangs](#bangs) to insert into subsequent sessions.

In the campaign I'm playing now, at the start of each session I verbally summarize the previous session's summary and that seems to be both appreciated by at least some of my players as well as helps with getting players back into the appropriate roleplaying headspace by setting the scene and letting them take the wheel after that.

In previous campaigns, I'd try to write down important moments during each session but in practice I found that running the session and being a notetaker was too much for my small brain to handle. For whatever reason, after the session is over I've found it much easier to write down a summary...

## Make PC decisions matter

If players choose to react a certain way to an NPC or an encounter, remember this ([maybe write session summaries to help you remember](#write-session-summaries-even-if-you-dont-plan-on-sharing-them)) and, if appropriate, find a way to acknowledge this decision they made by providing an in-universe reaction to it.

How do other NPCs in the world react to the PCs now that they've done X? The PCs have gone out of their way to poke the beast?

This will make the world come alive in way that it wouldn't have otherwise. You don't need to simulate the whole world all at once, that would be insane, but if you can take note of the actions of PCs and how those actions will change the world in ways that the PCs can see (eventually) this will make the world much more interesting to play in than it would be otherwise because your players know that their actions matter and will have an impact on the world.

## Yes! And? But...

Yes, and-ing is a popular technique from the world of improv that a lot of people know about. Essentially, your response to an idea presented by a player should ideally be "Yes!" followed by the "And?" which is the world's reaction to the player choice that builds on their idea instead of shutting it down.

It's all about taking the ideas that your players present you with during a session and building on them constructively. This helps include everybody 

These ideas can extend beyond the limit of their character's decisions with the game. The more I can include players in the collaborative storytelling process the more invested they'll become in the story, because they've contributed to it.

In the context of tabletop roleplaying games, sometimes a player wants to do something completely out of whack with the world you're trying to build. This should happen rarely and more and more rarely over time as you and your players better understand the rules of the world you're in.

But if it does happen, feel free saying "No" but make to explain why and do everything you can to avoid saying "No". Because it will discourage your players from coming up with ideas that interest them moving forward

# Conclusion

More lessons to come. 

- let players tell you what they want (Yes! and? But... [optional])
  - if they're interacting with a room, NPC in a particular way (for example, interacting with a trap as though it was a puzzle with a reward at the end), then acknowledge this within the game world and tweak it on the fly to support the PCs desired interaction if appropriate, otherwise let the players know that this way of interacting with the object isn't desirable and move them onto the next room/event
