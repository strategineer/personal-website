A few weeks ago, I began running an old school rennaissance (mega)dungeon crawling tabletop roleplaying campaign using the Shadowdark RPG ruleset. It's proven to be the most successful of my attempts at GMing by far since my first and very poor attempt at it many many years ago (probably sometime around 2008-2009). Read on some more context on my roleplaying (or lack of) chops, otherwise [you can go straight to what I learned!](#what-i-learned).

I've always loved tabletop roleplaying ever since I first discovered it but throughout most of my life I participated in it sporadically. This changed in early 2019 when I found myself unemployed and with ample free time to explore hobbies and passions that I had neglected for many years, including tabletop roleplaying.

Since then I've been actively participating in tabletop roleplaying regularly and I've had the opportunity to run a few months-long campaigns with a few groups players in-person and online.

I've learned A LOT and I'd like to share what I've learned thus far in hopes that whoever reads this can avoid a lot of the pain and suffering that I and my players experienced as I learned the ropes of GMing.

# What I Learned

In no particular order, here's a list of lessons I learned throughout my recent experience of gming.

## Use Foundry VTT for hassle free snappy online roleplaying

The Foundry virtual tabletop is cheap and it, will, after a few hours of setup allow you to play your favorite tabletop roleplaying game online with little to no hassle.

Playing with it vs. without it is like night and day. Completely different and I know that I'm going to have a really hard time convince myself or my players to have sessions online without using Foundry VTT.

## Bring your characters to life with voices

At the minimum, give each NPC that speaks a particular vocal/verbal (or gestural if you're playing in person) gimmick that players can associate with the character so they can remember the character more easily when they show up again.

Worst case, if get some performance anxiety and I'm unable to call forth a particular voice then instead of fumbling through it I describe the voice to the players then speak normally.

## Write a one-pager for the one-shot or campaign you're planning to run

When GMing a one-shot or a campaign, it's important for you to make sure that you and all of your players are on the same page with respect to what kind of one-shot or campaign you're planning to run.

Your players need to know what kind of characters


This document will be handy for gathering players as well.

Refer to page 10 of Sly Flourish's The Lazy DM's Companion by Michael E. Shea for more details on this.

## Enforce basic relationships during character creation

No matter what system you're using, ensure that each PC has at least one relationship with another PC in the party as well as one relationship to someone in the world.

This helps tie the PCs together and ground them in the setting of the game. As the GM, you can use these relationships as the foundation for further integrting these characters in the world.

For example, Blotbug the goblin witch has a relationship to the Cult of the Shattered Moon who tried to ritually sacrifice him to their Dark God. He barely escaped with his life.

Is the Cult of the Shattered Moon still after him? If so, why? Why did they try to sacrifice him in particular? How has this event affected him? etc.

## Use the Stars and Wishes system to encourage a per-session constructive feedback loop that helps you GM better sessions for your players

The Stars and Wishes system ([described in more detail here](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/stars-and-wishes)) essentially forces players at the end of a session to provide positive and constructive feedback to other the GM and other players about the session. This creates a feedback loop that is extremely helpful as a GM because it ensures that your players are given ample opportunity to say what's working for them and what isn't so that you can change subsequent sessions accordingly and be confident that you're all having as much fun as possible.

A **Star** is simply a positive comment on one part of session, this can be another player's roleplaying, a voiced NPC, this can be a fun combat encounter, etc.

A **Wish** is simply something that the player wants for the next session, this can be something meta like wanting the group to have a leader to speed up the process of deciding where the party goes next or a story beat that they want their character to nail or if the party wants to put a spotlight on a particular character.

This system is simple but it's crazy how effective it is in both making me confident that as a group we're optimizing for fun and every session is building on the previous one in a way that everybody likes.

## Read So You Want to Be A Gamemaster by Justine Alexander (especially Bangs)

This is a great book with a bunch of cool stuff in it but the best thing are bangs. ...


##


- use a good adventure/module/dungeon and build on it instead of doing everything from scratch
  - gives me the space to focus on building story/NPCs/encounters specifically for PCs instead of having to build everything
- write summaries for each session
  - even if you don't plan on using them for anything (like verbally summarizing the previous session, at the start of a session), it's useful because you can pick out interesting moments / events and then give yourself an opportunity to build on that in your prep / writing of subsequent bangs
- make PC decisions matter
  - it doesn't have to be big, but even the smallest recognition of a choice that a player made previously, adds to the roleplaying experience in a big way
- let players tell you what they want (Yes! and? But... [optional])
  - if they're interacting with a room, NPC in a particular way (for example, interacting with a trap as though it was a puzzle with a reward at the end), then acknowledge this within the game world and tweak it on the fly to support the PCs desired interaction if appropriate, otherwise let the players know that this way of interacting with the object isn't desirable and move them onto the next room/event
