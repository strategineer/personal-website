A dark and dank cave, you see,

Murky and mouldy, walls surrounding me.

It feels safe, or at least, it used to,

Now, my monsters keep me company.

A tiny ray of light seeps through,

A gentle warmth between my toes.

Cup your ear and you'll hear,

The sound of those I left behind,

Praying for my salvation.
