We like to believe that we are free (as in freedom).

Under the crushing weight of the societal and economic constraints placed upon you, yes, you can choose. But your options might leave you wanting more.

None of us choose to be born. It kind of just happens.

I won't go into the details but, a long time ago, your biological parents touched base and a few months later you were brought into this world.

You had no say in the matter.

Who your parents are and where you're born in the world will have had a meteoric impact on the trajectory of your life.

The societal norms and laws that you must abide by are imposed on you at birth without your consent.

If you're lucky enough to be rich enough and your skin colour is the "right" shade then maybe you can migrate somewhere else. Somewhere with norms and laws that are more to your liking but you will always be constrained by what others believe.

But, what about you?

Did you really "choose" to be the person you are today?

There's a kid I know. Spending just a few moments with them makes it clear to me that their brain has been mangled beyond belief by the constant stream of ads and "influencers" they're exposed to.

This makes me question my own beliefs and where they come from.

Who am I if not a product of my genes and my environment?

What else is there and, if there is anything else, how can I tell it apart from the rest of what I consider to be me?
