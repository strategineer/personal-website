[Go through a list of autistic memes and explain them for neurotypicals]

[Let's leverage memes for good, they're used for evil, let's teach people about autism through memes that they probably won't understand. If they think they're funny or resonate then maybe you're autistic. Not a replacement for a diagnosis (self or otherwise) but better than nothing]

[the boundaries are flexible and it's better that way. If people feel heard and understood within a community then good, whether they are "confirmed" or not.]

[write down every autistic related thing I've ever talked about to avoid repeating myself]

[no purely information memes, they don't need explaining and will never be funny (carrot on the stick)]

Being autistic means different things to different people. Although it absolutely not the case that "everyone is a little autistic" and "autistism is just a phase".

Yes, there's no such thing as THE autistic experience but there's such a thing as AN autistic experience.

Muddying the waters even further is Also, autistic people, and neurodivergent people broadly, have been forced to live with 

I can't speak for all autistic people and I'm not trying to. All I can do is speak to my own experience.

Why talk about this?

Well, firstly, the misinformation spread about autistic people in the media is beyond belief. It has produced a world of people who have no clue what being autistic actually is . This lack of understanding leads to a variety of problems for autistic people but primarily serves to alienate them and exclude them from a society that doesn't accept them for who they are.

Secondly, I've been wanting to write about my autistic experience for years but I haven't had the mental energy to actually sit down and do it. Critically thinking about the cross I've been forced to bear is not something you just do, it's commitment I've made to actually trying to make the world a better place even though.

Thirdly, you're not alone. In my darkest moments, I wish that I knew who I was and that my experience is shared among many others.


I do a quite a bit of journaling. It's probably not surprising to anyone that I'm the kind of person who gets a lot out of writing my thoughts on paper.

There's a few terms that get thrown around to describe autistic people throughout their lives. Interestingly, neurotypical people are extremely efficient at diagnosing neurodivergence and handling it in their own way (bullying, exclusion,).

Yet, when someone says "Hey, I'm autistic" the response : "Ya, everyone is!" (no they're not), "I don't think you are." (you know me better than I do?), "You don't seem autistic." (that's because you don't know what being autistic is, because the media has completely warped your perception of it to the point of complete incomprehension).

When it comes to issues of identity, just listen to the person identifying themselves in a certain way, they absolutely know better than you do who and what they are.

"He's an old soul" (he's autistic)

"He's detail-oriented" (he's autistic)

Euphismisms like these are harmful. If I had known that I was autistic, my life would be so different that the one I have now (for the better). Also, they are evidence that being autistic is stigmatized to such a degree that people don't want to say the word.

I can say a lot of things about our boy Kojima but his sniper shot of the century was realizing that connection is big.

My whole life I'm wanted to connect. This sisyphean task of connecting. With all this baggage and weight holding me down. Accept me you sick fucks. Let me be myself. Empathy you asshole, have you heard of it?



including trauma the media presents autistic coded characters in some truly awful ways that serve only to warp the public's perception of a marginalized group 

A common phrase that gets used to describe autistic people is that they are "in their time and space" (maori?). It's legit. It feels like a description that accurately captures the broad strokes feeling of what it is to be autistic and be around those who are autistic. I think it all goes back to thoughts and communicating those thoughts to others which is one of the main ways we can try to grasp what's going on in someone else's head
