I've been cutting my own hair for the past few years.

Here's what I've learned:

- A decent hair trimmer costs as much as a single haircut. If you can learn how to cut your own hair with one then you can save a little time and money.
- If you're looking to give yourself a buzzcut then buy yourself a hair trimmer and enjoy saving yourself time and money by cutting your own hair.
- I don't like the way buzzcuts look on me so I need to do a little more work.
- Cutting my own hair well is hard. But it didn't take me many haircuts to learn how to do it semi-competently.
- Cutting my hair right before I'm expecting to appear in public is a big mistake. I need to wait a day or two for my hair to grow out a little to cover up any of the mistakes I've made near the ears and back of the neck.
- Except for my first haircut or two (which were so questionable that people commented on it), nobody has noticed that I cut my own hair.
- But, people have yet to really be wowed by my haircuts... If you want to look extremely sexy for a few days after you cut your hair, there's no shortcut. Go to a professional and pray they don't fuck it up.
- I cut my hair in one of two ways:
  - Generic Short Haircut (very short hair at neck level, short hair at ear level and longer hair on top of my head).
  - Generic Short Alternative Haircut (same thing except a little more hair on top, think mini Pompadour).
- These hair styles are nothing special but at least I don't look like a Neo-Nazi.
