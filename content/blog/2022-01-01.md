There's a big (but portable) blue button with the word "KILL" painted on it (called the kill button).

Every time you press the button, a human being on the planet dies and X money is added to your bank account.

How much does X have to be for you to press the button? If you would never press the button no matter how much money you get for doing so, explain why.

If, for some value of X, you decide to press the button then how many times do you press it and why?

> Wrinkle \#1: Keep in mind, that every time you press the button, there's a chance that the kill button kills you. Are you still willing to take that risk? Does knowing this change how often you press the button?
