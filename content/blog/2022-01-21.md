When I was a kid, I would shit a brick whenever I had to think about needles.

A teacher would bring up needles in the context of a science/health class, I would turn green, feel sick to my stomach and, rarely but sometimes, dry heave into a toilet bowl until the fear-induced panic attack passed.

Look at me now, Dad. I can get a vaccine anytime I want without having any psychosomatic reactions to them.

I went to get my third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine today. It went well.

Unfortunately, you're not allowed to take pictures in a vaccination center but thankfully I can describe what I saw there to you.

I walked in. We got new masks and sanitized our hands. We got into the line and waited.

Here's what I saw:
- People queuing up to get stabbed/shot (including myself).
- Nurses checking people in and giving them shots.
- Soldiers in green camouflage gear herding people and processing them (some of these lads were a little twinkier than I would have expected \#militarytwinks).
- Big posters with Nintendo, Star Wars, Marvel characters.
- Pet therapy dogs.

It was a lot to think about at once.

Melissa did a great job.
