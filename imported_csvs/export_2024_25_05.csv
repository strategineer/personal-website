The story takes place in a classroom that's drifting... If you're a fan of Junji Ito's work like Uzumaki then you should check this one out too.",1

A bunch of different people arrive for a relaxing day at the beach and find themselves aging extremely rapidly, babies become teens and older folk die. Hijinks ensue. I don't get it.<br/><br/>I didn't like Sandcastle. I'm not exactly qualified to critique graphic novels. I'm either too stupid to understand what it's trying to say or it's not trying to say anything at all. Either way, it didn't make me feel anything... Maybe I'm dead inside?",1

It's just a bunch of transcripts taken from Noam Chomsky Q/A sessions, but man, I'm glad that I was convinced to sit down and read through it.<br/><br/>Noam Chomsky has eidetic memory (more commonly known as photographic memory) and so you can ask him about anything and he'll be able to perfectly recall everything he's read and written about the subject. So, even transcripts of his Q/A sessions can be just as informative and important as anything else you've read in your life.<br/><br/>The book covers many important topics relating to ""Power"" but it mainly focuses on the US, and the many atrocities its leaders have played a part in, across the world.<br/><br/>Reading this book was difficult. It challenged me to reevaluate many of my preconceived notions about how the world works and I'm better for it.<br/><br/>It's also a book that I recommended to many people, and half a year later, not a single person has taken the time to read it...<br/><br/>I probably didn't give them a good pitch for it (maybe this isn't a good pitch either?) but in the new year I'm looking forward to improving my ability to retain information about the books I read and give better pitches for them!<br/><br/>If you decide to read one book I mention here, it should probably be this one, but honestly you would probably have more fun reading this next one.",1

In exploring railroad tracks, antenna towers, highway overpasses, power lines, coal mines, nuclear power plants, grain elevators, oil refineries, steel mills, and more, Brian Hayes reveals how our familiar and often-overlooked industrial environment can be as dazzling as nature.<br/><br/>Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the Industrial Landscape is exactly what you think it is and it's amazing. It's a book that covers anything that you could consider to be ""Infrastructure"" (water treatment, electricity, farming, cargo ships, airplanes, mining, etc.) and gives you a broad yet deep understanding of how it all works through clear writing and beautiful photos taken by the author himself.<br/><br/>After reading Infrastructure, I now have a better understanding of all the infrastructure that surrounds me and this knowledge prevents me from taking anything for granted. I now know what others needed to build (and need to maintain) for me to be able to flip a light switch on and off or pour myself a glass of water.",1

This amounts to him basically saying ""Just write a lot bro"" but despite this, this was quite a fun read. And... He's not wrong.<br/><br/>On Writing by Stephen King is half part autobiography and half part a guide to writing. You probably know Stephen King's work and you've probably seen one of the thousands of movie adaptations of his books like It, Carrie or Shawshank Redemption). He is extremely prolific and he's one of my favorite writers so when I heard that he wrote this book on writing, I picked it up right away.<br/><br/>On Writing does not disappoint. He tells the story of his life and his road to becoming the writer he is today. As you would expect, it's a real page turner. Stephen King could write about paint drying and you would be glued to your seat.<br/><br/>Eventually, Stephen starts to give advice to people who want to become better writers. He mostly just says to write what you know and to practice every day? To be fair, I've become a better writer since I started following his advice soooooooooooo he must be onto something.<br/><br/>There's one passage in particular that has been stuck in my brain for a while now and here it is.<br/><br/>He says that ""Writing is telephathy.""<br/><br/><b>Look- here's a table covered with red cloth. On it is a cage the size of a</b> <b>small fish aquarium. In the cage is a white rabbit with a pink nose and</b> <b>pink-rimmed eyes. […] On its back, clearly marked in blue ink, is the numeral 8.

Cocktails, Everybody!</a><br/><br/>My buddy who's a bartender recommended this to me when I expressed interest in learning how to mix cocktails. It's got a bunch of good cocktail recipes and historical context for most of them (if you're into that kind of thing).<br/><br/>Interestingly, in the first few pages, Gary describes bartenders as being ""Ganymedes"", a young boy (remember this) who is the immortal cupbearer of Olympus in Greek mythology. This comparison is one you would probably avoid after reading Robert Graves's take on Ganymedes.<br/><br/>Robert posits that Ganymedes was a character created by the Greeks/Romans much later on and ""retconned"" back into the mythology to legitimize their rampant pederasty. Have fun with that information.",1

It's not meant to entertain, it's meant to inform. Although, if learning everything there is to know about Greek myths sounds entertaining to you then this is the book for you.<br/><br/>I've always been fascinated by Greek mythology but my understanding of it came from the sanitized stories I read in D'Aulaires Book Of Greek Myths and secondhand from the many modern interpretations of the myths I had seen throughout my life.<br/><br/><img src=""https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/d_aulaires_book_of_greek_myths.jpg"" width=""40"" height=""100"" /><br/><br/>Prior to reading this book, I had never really taken the time to dive deep into Greek mythology.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did because now I cringe thinking about all the times I said that I prefer Greek mythology to Christianity because it's: ""way funner"".<br/><br/>I mean, in some ways, it is buuuuuuut also Zeus rapes a lot (they don't really talk about that in d'Aulaires illustrated book for kids)...<br/><br/>If you want to learn about every single Greek myth that exists, then you should read this book.

So, there's not really much we know about Norse mythology.<br/><br/>In his book titled Norse Mythology, Neil Gaiman riffs on what we know about the Norse myths and creates his own retellings of the stories and some completely new ones.<br/><br/>It's OK. I like a lot of Neil Gaiman's work (especially American Gods), his passion for mythology is clear and it shines through most of his work. Unfortunately, I don't think I have as much of an appreciation for Norse mythology as he does and reading this book didn't change that.",1

There's no reason to use archaic English, which apparently is the norm with these kinds of texts, when translating a text that was originally in Greek. It's a poem with the same number of lines as the original which is just plain fun.<br/><br/>It's an interesting text and now I understand why some people decide to spend their entire lives thinking about it.<br/><br/>Odysseus is a mass murderer and a villain… yet in the story he's presented as a victim and a hero.

It took me a while (until early 2022) to read the book written by one of the hosts (Gretchen McCulloch), but here we are.<br/><br/>Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language is a book that discusses how we express ourselves on the internet, how we got here and where we're going from the perspective of a linguist.<br/><br/>I am what the book refers to as a ""Full Internet Person"" having gotten online in the early 2000s, chatting with friends using MSN Messenger, then later Facebook and, eventually, I started writing super cringe blog posts on Tumblr (some might say that I never stopped).<br/><br/>One topic covered in the book is how the use of linguistic gestures/emblems online (like emoticons and emoji) has changed over the past few decades.<br/><br/>Gestures are an integral part of human nature and communication. They're instinctual and they're deeply ingrained in us.<br/><br/>Two people who are blind at birth, when speaking to each other, will make gestures despite neither of them being able to see the gestures.<br/><br/>Words are great, but by limiting ourselves to words and only words, we're missing out on a wide range of tools we can use to express ourselves. Especially in informal contexts, where expressing how you feel quickly and easily, without having to be a genius writer, is useful.<br/><br/>In the letters that people used to write to each other (in a pre-internet world), it was quite common to see words mixed in with doodles of hearts and smiley faces.<br/><br/>We've been doing this for a long time, it's just that the way we imbue gestures into our writing has changed as the technologies we use to communicate with each other have evolved.<br/><br/>In the West, we started off with emoticons like :-P, :(, ;) (the nose was dropped sometime in the 2000s).<br/><br/>In Asia, kaomoji were used in similar ways.<br/><br/>^\_^<br/><br/>o_O<br/><br/>¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯<br/><br/>Sidenote: You'll notice that emoticons tend to have similar eyes and different mouths whereas the opposite can be said for kaomoji. This is because in Asia, it's more common for people to look at someone's eyes when trying to figure out that person's emotional state. Whereas people in the West tend to look at mouths instead.<br/><br/>This might explain why anime characters usually have gigantic eyes...<br/><br/>We have the Japanese to thank for many things, emoji is just one of them.[^1] In 1999, Shigetaka Kurita was inspired by the use of symbolic representations in manga, like a water drop on someone's face to represent nervousness or confusion, and created one of the first emoji sets for cellphones.<br/><br/>In the late 2000s, Apple decided that they wanted their iPhones to support emojis specifically for the Japanese market. They did the work to make that happen and, finally, decided to add support for emojis across the globe.<br/><br/>Emojis caught on in a big way all over the world and, eventually, they became ubiquitous (if you're chatting with someone on the internet in 2022, no matter what application you're using, you probably have access to emojis and you likely use them quite a bit).<br/><br/>Because Internet also talks about the various ways in which people have tried to imbue tone of voice into their internet writing (with varying degrees of success).<br/><br/><b>hey</b><br/><br/><b>you</b><br/><br/><b>listen</b><br/><br/>Short utterances without punctuation like this might have been popular with the zoomers on Tumblr/Twitter?<br/><br/><b>I'm ~very~ excited about this ~new~ sarcasm marker.</b><br/><br/>But no, actually, I am.

I actually laughed out loud quite a few times and that's something i cherish because writing comedic novels is anything but easy.<br/><br/>The novel has a unique voice that might rub some people the wrong way. The way that the many run-on sentences were written gave the text an almost lyrical vibe that felt like a good fit given the premise of the book.<br/><br/>I would have given Space Opera a 5/5 but unfortunately I feel as though the book would have benefited greatly from more of a focus on the main character Danesh and his partner in crime Oort. Spending more time with them, experiencing their newly expanded world (filled with many alien aliens) from their perspective would have been great. Instead, many chapters are spent describing in detail the events/winners of past Metagalactic Grand Prix(s).<br/><br/>These chapters are fine in isolation but, within the context of the rest of the novel, they clash with the more personal chapters preceding and following them leading to a less fulfilling read (at least for me).<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend Space Opera if you're looking for something light, that might make you smile and chuckle more than you would expect.",1

She becomes like her namesake from myth who could see into the future but was cursed to never be believed.<br/><br/>Cassandra begins to use her power to change her past, present and future and, in doing so, discovers who she is and who she wants to become.<br/><br/>That's the gist of it. It's a really well told story (with properly thought out time travel mechanics) that will keep you hooked and waiting with expectation to see what happens next.<br/><br/><b>Everything is too far away and too close at the same time, too loud and also too quiet; a yellow door, an orange can, a blue sliver of sky, a dropped navy glove, the red ring around a street sign; a kaleidoscope turning.</b><br/><br/><b>A pigeon flaps violently and I put my hands over my face.</b><br/><br/><b>It's coming.</b><br/><br/><b>It's coming and without my banana muffin there is nothing I can do to stop it.</b><br/><br/>Like a cathartic Greek myth, Cassandra in Reverse has high highs and low lows (and everything in between) that'll make you smile and cry (or at least tear up a little if you're an emotionally stunted man child like me hehehe).<br/><br/>Cassandra reads as autistic from page 1. The dust jacket describes the author as having received an autism diagnosis in 2021. From the very start, it's obvious that Cassandra in Reverse is about autism.<br/><br/>All the challenges Cassandra faces at the start of the novel are the result of her being autistic and living in world (like our own) that is usually unfriendly and, sometimes, outright hostile to people who think and act differently than the majority (including autistic people).<br/><br/>As a fellow autist, I found Cassandra's journey very relatable (not the ""being able to control time"" part but the ""being an autist"" part).<br/><br/>Reading through it and relating Cassandra's struggles to my own gave me a boost of positive energy and good vibes that I was craving. There's something magical about reading a book that feels purposefully written to cater to you and your interests.<br/><br/>Depictions of autism in media are mostly terrible. This skews the public perception of autism making it that much harder to get people to understand what it actually is and how it affects people.<br/><br/>Cassandra in Reverse portrays an autistic character so well that it serves as a crash course into what autism can look like. This depiction can allow readers to gain a better understanding of autism and, in doing so, might lead some readers down the path of diagnosis and, hopefully, a better life.<br/><br/>I can attest to the fact that being autistic and not knowing about it is one of the worst experiences I've lived through (not everybody lives through it).<br/><br/>Everything you do is wrong and you don't understand why. People look at you funny and you don't understand why. You have to fight tooth and nail for things that come naturally to other people.<br/><br/>It can negatively impact every single part of your life and it really sucks.<br/><br/>Once you understand what autism is and how it affects you, you can finally have a chance at leading a life of happiness instead of one of constant alienation.<br/><br/>If reading Cassandra in Reverse is what it takes to make someone go from not knowing about their autism to knowing about it then not only is it a well written novel that'll make you FEEL THINGS (tm) but it's also providing an invaluable service to humanity.<br/><br/>And so, I'm giving it 5 stars and nobody can stop me.",1
9780765387462,2023/06/18,fiction fantasy read,read,1,4,"It was an enjoyable romp but doesn't necessarily hit the highs of the previous books in the series. As the third and final(ish) book in the series I was expecting something a little bit more. Or maybe I was expecting a little bit less, a more tightly edited and polished story. Either would have been nice.<br/><spoiler><br/>Here's some thoughts:<br/>- It's difficult to tell a story about an antagonistic character who is basically a god. You have to constantly give reasons to explain why they don't just kill everybody and achieve their evil goals. More than either of the two previous books, I had to shut my brain off and just enjoy the ride no matter how implausible the plot felt at times.<br/>- Giving minor characters their own POV chapters brought a lot of life into them. Making the world feel a little more interesting and less centered around the larger than life main characters. Unfortunately all these characters are eventually killed off, which ends up feeling a little cheap.<br/>- Kell is a bit of a boring character. He doesn't really have an arc or change at all from the start of the story all the way through to the end. That said, most characters in this series are pretty stable in terms of their goals and beliefs throughout the story but at least they're a bit more interesting than Kell.<br/>- The side story where most of the main characters escape from the city in search of the MacGuffin feels like filler. Also, I hate MacGuffins.<br/>- A bunch of characters bite their lip and I don't think that's an actual thing people do (other than in Twilight). Please correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the time I spent with the book (and the series as a whole) but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was a little shorter.<br/><br/></spoiler>",1

Although that's mostly true, I don't think this book needs one.<br/><br/>This is a story about people, it focuses on them and their evolving relationships with one another, finding common ground despite their differences. That's more than enough to keep someone enraptured for however long it takes them to read the book (I know I was).<br/><br/>But if you're looking for a story about a ragtag group of underdogs overcoming stacked odds to save the universe, you'll have to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something a little bit out there, and are ok with reading something with less action, less sex (although there is some of that) and fewer universe ending apocalypses than you're used to, then I can highly recommend this book.<br/><br/>Here be spoilers, you've been warned:<br/><spoiler><br/>The book has an optimistic tone but it isn't wishy-washy when it comes to the grittier topics it tackles. For example, one of the characters, Speaker, is a member of a species that is very clearly a stand-in for Jewish people (systemically oppressed/enslaved, forced to be nomads with no land to call their own, etc).<br/><br/>NB: I would love to hear an expert talk about this portrayal. I can't point fingers necessarily but I definitely raise an eyebrow at the author's choice to portray the Jewish stand-in race as tiny gremlins with hooks for hands.<br/><br/>This book doesn't shy away from portraying the systemic discrimination that Speaker and her species is subjected to. By the end of the book, systemic discrimination isn't ""solved"" but the characters come to terms with their differences, their prejudice and tackle them head on.<br/><br/>This lines up with real world social psychology theories on how to go about successfully breaking down barriers and achieving understanding and compassion between different groups of people. My knowledge of the social psychology behind this combined with this portrayal helped make this story feel believable to me.<br/><br/>One minor complaint I have is that every character has a tragic backstory (or is going through puberty) that is revealed over the course of the book. It feels a little melodramatic but I eventually got over it. Because of this and the fact that most ""scenes"" involve characters standing around and talking to each other, the novel feels more like a dramatic play than a book. This isn't a bad thing, it's just something I noticed.<br/><br/>I think we're going to see a lot of authors copy Becky Chambers's writing style in the coming years. What she's doing in this book seems like a recipe for success and I expect her to cash in on this format, rightfully so. And I'm excited to read the other books she's written in this series, the rest of her work.<br/><br/></spoiler>",1

The world didn't turn, it just went into a spin.</b><br/><br/>Thud! is about prejudice. The main plot as well as every sub plot has something to say about prejudice, how it can cloud our judgement and prevent us from doing the right thing and treating everyone with the respect they deserve.<br/><br/>The choice to have the protagonist be a prototypical white man in a position of power is great because I would have had a hard time taking the novel seriously if Terry Pratchett, a very white man, had chosen to tell this story from the perspective of a minority.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes is an honest man doing the best he can but sometimes that's just not good enough. So, for me, throughout the novel, he flip-flopped between being the hero I was rooting for and the antihero I loved to hate.<br/><br/><b>Minor story spoilers</b><br/><spoiler><br/>An example of this is when Sam Vimes suffers a particularly heinous attack from a few deep dwarves. He feels extremely angry and frustrated about this (rightfully so) but unfortunately he expresses that anger by mistreating other dwarves who had nothing to do with the attack.<br/><br/>This hits home for me because it's something we see time and time again in our own world.<br/><br/>For example, post-911, Muslims around the world suffered from an increase in hate crimes against them. This is a tragedy because the actions of a few extremists (completely divorced from Islam) led to all this hate being directed towards the wrong people. Another more recent example of this was post-COVID, there was a similar increase in hate crimes towards Asian people who, obviously, had nothing to do with COVID, other than suffering because of it like everyone else.<br/><br/>So when Vimes starts getting pissed at dwarves in the same way, it felt real.<br/></spoiler><br/>Thud! is filled with situations like this; touching on issues like discrimination in the workplace, police brutality, racism, etc. that lend a weight to the story that isn't usually present in other Discworld novels. I'm really into it!<br/><br/>Thud! was published right after Going Postal (which is my favorite Discworld novel I've read so far) and they seem to share quite a bit of DNA. With Going Postal dealing with capitalism, toxic corporate culture, bureaucracy (and more!) instead of the topics covered in Thud!.<br/><br/>If you like Going Postal, you might like Thud! (and vice-versa). I love both tremendously.<br/><br/>As of right now, Thud! has taken my second favorite Terry Pratchett novel slot; bumping Thief of Time down to a respectable third place.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with Terry Pratchett. He's just so consistently good at what he does, and I love his work because of it.",1

Because I know deep down that no matter what I do, I will never be accepted as I am, warts and all.<br/><br/>Like one orogene in particular, sometimes I feel as though it would be best for us to shatter the world we live in and start over.<br/><br/>The Fifth Season is one of the best novels I've ever read.

Like genocide, slavery and other topics covered in this book, autism is not inherently funny and the way it's tackled in this book is insulting.<br/><br/>Is the inclusion of a character who reads as autistic inherently bad? No, of course not. It depends on how the character is written and how the author treats them.<br/><br/>For example, Terry Pratchett writes stereotypically autistic characters in his Discworld books (see Thief of Time and Going Postal for some obvious examples of this).

It's not something I've seen before (which either speaks to my uncultured-ness or the lack of minority voices in the media I'm exposed to... or both).<br/><br/>The story was simple (maybe too simple) but executed well. But it's definitely not a story for a younger demographic though -- it's got a few extremely explicit descriptions of sex in it (I've read some erotica in my day but this was something else).<br/><br/>It's a story about a mixed Indigenous lady, Joan, who's husband goes missing.<br/><br/>We follow Joan as she uncovers the mystery about what really happened to her beloved Victor with the help of her cousin Zeus and her extended family.<br/><br/>There's a few surprises along the way. It was a riveting read although the narrative unfolds in a way that left me scratching my head at times.<br/><br/>The choice to zoom in on the backstory of relatively minor characters was a little weird. An attempt was made to make these characters less like caricatures but it wasn't very successful IMO.<br/><br/>The ending comes out of nowhere with characters doing absolutely wacky shit which was really hard for me to believe. It also happens very quickly. I would have preferred a bit more buildup before the end as well as a bit more of a denouement.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed what I read and I'm excited to read whatever Cherie Dimaline comes up with next.

This series is advertised as a story for kids but it's written in such a way that it's just as interesting reading through it as an adult. A younger reader wouldn't catch all the subtext (and there's a lot of it).<br/><br/>As the oldest kid (11 years old) in his family, Gregor is tasked with taking care of his 2 year old baby sister over the summer while his single mother (Gregor's father ""disappeared"" one night) works to put food on the table.<br/><br/>His grandmother lives with them and has Dementia (although Gregor doesn't know that's what it is).<br/><br/><b>For the last year his grandma had been slipping in and out of reality. One minute she was clear as a bell and the next she was calling him Simon. Who was Simon? He had no idea.</b><br/><br/>Gregor doesn't speak like a child, in a lot of ways he's a grown ass man in a boy's body. Children don't speak like this:<br/><br/><b>""Great, Day One and I'm looking forward to a trip to the laundry room,"" Gregor thought. ""By September, I'll probably be ecstatic when we get the phone bill.""</b><br/><br/>This is fine because:<br/>1. It makes it easier for me to step into Gregor's shoes.<br/>2. It makes him more interesting.<br/>3. Trauma forces you to grow up quicker than normal.<br/><br/>Gregor is old at heart and he's been through some shit. He's depressed as hell because he misses his dad.<br/><br/><b>Gregor tried to remember the last time he'd felt as happy as Boots did with her ball. He had had some decent times over the past couple of years. [...] But if he was honest with himself, Gregor knew it had been years since he'd felt real happiness.</b><br/><br/>THIS IS A BOOK FOR CHILDREN, PLEASE SEND HELP!<br/><br/>Not only has Gregor been through ""some"" shit, he's about to go through ""the"" shit because each book involves Gregor going on a military/diplomatic mission in a world at war, or about to be at war.<br/><br/>Story spoilers for the end of the first book:<br/><spoiler><br/>I know why this series is so important to me and blows me away whenever I read it. I experienced a lot of trauma as a kid, I'm not sure I've overcome that trauma by now but I know that it made me who I am today.<br/><br/>And so, I empathize with Gregor more than most people could. When he falls into a hole behind the washing machine and finds himself thrust into another world where fascists rats are committing humanitarian atrocities, I'm shaking in anticipation at the edge of my seat waiting for Gregor to figure things out, find the people he needs to find and find his way back home with the help of the friends he makes along the way.<br/><br/>This series is great. Is it perfect? No. I find it a little odd that the books contain prophecies (which are somewhat open to interpretation but seem to be more than just self-fulfilling) referring to the wars between the inhabitants of the Underland implying that these wars are inevitable.<br/><br/>This is at odds with the series's anti-war message because in a world where war is inevitable, the people involved in it shouldn't be held morally accountable for it. Right? If you're fated/forced to do something then you shouldn't be blamed for the consequences of your actions.<br/><br/>I don't think Suzanne Collins is saying that wars in the real world are inevitable but these prophecies do weaken the series's anti-war message while also providing a driving force to thrust Gregor into the thick of things and propel the story in interesting directions.<br/></spoiler><br/>Overall though, this story is a story to end all stories. It's so good. It's Suzanne Collins's best work and she wrote the Hunger Games (also pretty good) so that's saying something.<br/><br/>This story has no right to be this good. And yet it is.

It's fun, it's cute and it subverts enough tropes to keep you guessing. I got a kick out of the main villain being a rich tech bro dickhead.<br/><br/>In both of her novels, Xiran portrays main characters who commit murder (and other crimes against humanity) but it's ok because ""the ends justify the means"".

I've only covered the tip of the iceberg in this review because reading through this book has left me completely drained of energy. Please don't read this book, it is beyond trash. If you really want to, I can't stop you but I really wish I could.<br/><br/>I have an important question for y'all.<br/><br/>Is this how people speak?<br/><br/><b>""He must have had help, yes. Stalker surely helped him, it was worth her while to do it. Do you think it would be less worth the Raven's, to offer such opportunity to my father? Even with the god so distant, between Instruments, it's a small thing to provide a sharp edge, a weapon in reach, anything. And do you imagine that, offered that help, my father would have failed to take it? He was loyal to the Raven. He was the Lease, and he knew his duty.""</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>On one hand, this is great art because reading through dialogue like this makes me question my own existence. Is it really possible that a human being wrote this paragraph of dialogue and was like: ""Job's done... My God, I'm good!""?<br/><br/>On the other hand, reading dialogue like this is immersion breaking and I don't like it.<br/><br/>It gets worse.<br/><br/>What is the purpose of having characters speaking in awfully written broken English?<br/><br/><b>""A funeral. The old Lease is not have a funeral. There is a new Lease--I know it is so. I am in Vastai for days and days and the Lease is not see us. Now the Lease is see us--once--and this man who is the Lease is not the Lease before.""</b><br/><br/>I'm not an expert linguist so maybe it's possible for someone to learn language X then try to learn language Y and the result of that is this. Maybe?<br/><br/>But why?<br/><br/>I just read through Shards of Earth by Adrian Tchaikovsky which is a book featuring many alien beings who speak in a variety of weird ways all serving to give them a unique identity and immerse you into the world.<br/><br/>Like yes, the crab people speaking through a translator device of questionable quality would be different and the author can use that difference as a tool to craft a more compelling narrative.<br/><br/>And comparing that to this is jarring. Nobody is benefiting from the dialogue being written this way, just let these characters speak normally or make them speak in an interesting way that reflects a difference in their beliefs, unique to them. Something, anything! Not like this.<br/><br/>Let's move on.<br/><br/>Not only is the way the dialogue is written bad but what characters choose to say to each other is also awful.<br/><br/>There are many conversations in this book where each character seems to know everything that every other character knows. It sounds like each of them is reading from a terrible script handed down to them by a single person.<br/><br/>Obviously, all books are written this way. But an author's job is to convince the reader that these characters actually exist, each having their own goals, behaviors, etc. and aren't just mindless puppets controlled entirely by the author.<br/><br/>You could argue that this awful writing is explained by the premise of the book. The fact that the story is narrated by a god in a universe where a god's words have power and in saying something it becomes true.<br/><br/>However, even if that's the case, I dislike when books have premises that explain away the author's inability to write well (refer to I'm Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reid for another example of this)<br/><br/>Is everything in this book terrible? No. But it's hard for me to focus on the OK parts of the book because the bad parts are so bad.<br/><br/>The story is split into two POVs. One of a god and one of a person. The characterization of Eolo, the person, is really bad and his chapters are weak (and filled with awful dialogue). The god's POV is better because it has much less dialogue and it's weird in a way that has potential.<br/><br/>It feels like Ann Leckie wrote a decent story from a unique perspective (the god) and was told that it wouldn't sell because it would be hard for readers to relate to a god who is literally just a big rock.<br/><br/>So, she had to go back in and interlace another story with human characters that people could relate to more easily.<br/><br/>And so, we get a novel that's very uneven with half the chapters being equal parts boring and unbelievable and the other half being not fully realized.<br/><br/>I'm going to add Ann Leckie to my growing list of hack authors who had a single good idea in them.<br/><br/>But that one good idea that made them successful was a fluke. Despite continuously going back to that well, they don't understand what actually made their first successful work resonate with people and so are unable to recreate the success they achieved in the past.<br/><br/>It's sad to see these authors who at one time were put on a pedestal and told: ""Hey, you're special, keep it up!"". Only for everyone to eventually realize that it was all lies. Actually they weren't special, they were lucky.<br/><br/>Everyone's luck runs out at some point, it's not a matter of if but a matter of when. And some authors are luckier than others.<br/><br/>Life's short, I can't afford to waste my time reading a book like this again. Ann Leckie you've been banned, my eyes shall never grace a page of text you've written ever again. I wish you all the best.<br/><br/>Unlucky authors list: Neil Gaiman, Ann Leckie, Jeff VanderMeer",1

The rest of the novels didn't hit me as hard but they were interesting nonetheless.<br/><br/>Dawn - 5 stars Adulthood Rites - 3 stars Imago - 3 stars<br/><br/>What follows is mostly me rambling about the series.<br/><br/>This series is about biological determinism, consent, imbalanced power dynamics and sexual violence (among other things). Although, the books don't wrestle with these topics as much as I think they should have.<br/><br/>The first book contains a scene of sexual violence that is really phucked up despite not being very explicit. Overall, this book goes HARD. The imagery is powerful and will stick with me for a long time to come.<br/><br/>Adulthood Rites, the second book in the series, follows, from the POV of a mixed-species boy, the story of humanity repopulating the Earth and the tensions between the settlements of human-alien hybrids and the Human resisters who've chosen to be sterilized but free(ish) from alien influence.<br/><br/>It's not as memorable as the first book. It lacks the novelty and the raw-ness of the first book.<br/><br/>The third book in the series, Imago, follows the story of a one of a kind mixed-species ooloi (neither man or woman, a third sex) as it discovers who it is and what it can do (a lot -- it can manipulate the genes of others and itself at will). Despite having an intriguing premise, it's the weakest of the three books. It's ending feels rushed and the lead up to it was disappointing.<br/><br/>It feels as though the series would have been better served by spending more time reckoning with the fact that as the protagonists become less and less human in each book, what comes naturally to them (AKA using pheromones and the best sex skills this side of the universe to have sex with people who ARE NOT biologically capable of providing actual consent) is extremely phucked up and turns them into monsters (at least from the perspective of the reader).<br/><br/>Lilith's Brood is so far removed from the reality that we live in that I found it hard to extrapolate much of anything meaningful from the text other than the absolute rollercoaster ride of emotions that I got from reading the first book.<br/><br/>The text is outlandish but it also seems somewhat uninterested in tackling the ethical issues it takes on through its premise. And so, I felt a little disappointed by the end. I was expecting for a bit more push and pull and more of a focus on the ethics of it all.<br/><br/>Although, I felt that, other than a few minor issues, the world felt internally consistent for the most part. And it was easy for me to immerse myself in the universe that Butler built. Despite feeling somewhat cold on the series as a whole, I'm pretty invested in Butler's writing and I'm interested in reading more from her.<br/><br/>She's blown me away with how bold her writing can be.

It's just inconsistent and a little long.<br/><br/>The setting is cool in theory but in execution I'm left feeling as though it's internally inconsistent (and so, less believable than it could be otherwise).<br/><br/>Words are used in dialogue that don't fit in universe but serve to convey ideas to the 21st century reader. What's the likelihood that people in this universe would say things like: ""Yaaaaassssss""? Probably zero, but characters, especially the main character Gideon, say things like this a lot.<br/><br/>Gideon feels like she's been transported straight from our modern day into this universe that's completely unlike our own. I LIKE her but I wish she was in another novel. She exists to be relatable to the reader and that's fine I guess but her existence is so dissonant that it's hard to ignore.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the murder mystery. This novel is Agatha Christie-esque in that all the characters are invited to a gothic palace and are asked to investigate (compete?) in a quest to become gods. People start dying and we're supposed to care (but it's kind of hard to).<br/><br/>Throughout most of the story, we're as lost and confused as Gideon is (so A LOT). I haven't read enough murder mysteries to know if this sort of clueless POV can work, it doesn't work here.<br/><br/>Let's talk about relationships. Gideon's relationship with Harrow is hard to believe and how it evolves over time even harder. They start out hating each other and as time goes by, for no discernible reason, they become closer and transform into frenemies, then friends and then... Something else.<br/><br/>Their relationship is undeniably toxic in SO MANY ways, which is fine, but I find it hard to believe that either of these characters would want to be in the same room with one another.<br/><br/>What do I like about this book?<br/>- Gideon is cool (but she should be in another book).<br/>- The setting is cool (but certain details are inconsistent with the rest of what's presented and throw me off, eg. What is the economic system that is supplying the Ninth's Tomb planet with the titty mags and comic books that Gideon reads? Who's producing them and why?)<br/>- The location of the murder mystery is cool (but it's told from the perspective of a clueless character who just walks around, hangs out, then sometimes people die and eventually someone explains to her what's actually happening).<br/><br/>I'm conflicted on this one. I think if this book had sex in it instead of just being undeniably horny at all times maybe that would push me over the edge and get me to recommend this book.<br/><br/>As-is though, Gideon the Ninth suffers from enough ""First Author's Book Syndrome"" (a lot of small-ish problems that add up) that I can't recommend it. Although, it's got enough going for it that I would consider getting the second novel in the series on sale and seeing if some of my complaints are addressed.<br/><br/>The more distance I have from this book the more I feel I was a little nitpicky and unfair to it.<br/><br/>I like A LOT about it.<br/><br/>I'm excited to read the sequels which I've heard great things about.",1

All I know is that it makes reading his work harder than it needs to be.<br/><br/>If you're able to get past the way he writes, or perhaps even enjoy it if you're some kind of sicko, then you'll usually find an interesting story lying underneath with twists and turns that keep you emotionally invested in the world he's built.<br/><br/>Blindness is by far his most popular work and it's easy to see why. We follow a doctor and his wife during a pandemic of blindness as they, and others affected by the pandemic, are forced into a mental asylum repurposed to contain the newly blind.<br/><br/>The doctor's wife isn't really blind though (she seems to be immune to this new affliction). Lucky for us because the story is mostly told from her perspective.<br/><br/>Through her eyes we watch as the asylum fills up with the blind and we watch as they all struggle to perform the most simple of tasks rendered complex due to their lack of sight and their inexperience with this disability.<br/><br/>Tensions run high and conflict ensues as the last spark of hope is lost and gradually replaced with desperation and hunger for food and for control over their uncertain future.<br/><br/>Blindness (the affliction and the novel) is terrifying. Our eyesight is something we rely on more than any other sense to navigate and interact with the world around us.<br/><br/>The prospect of losing it is appropriately terrifying. Blindness (the novel) turns this fear into a reality we can perceive and forces us to imagine how horrifying it would be for you and everyone you know to lose their eyesight, and the chaos that would follow.<br/><br/>Even with a very surface level reading of the novel, Blindness offers a compelling narrative with meaningful stakes and mostly believable world building that sinks its teeth into you and doesn't let go until the very end.<br/><br/>I say mostly believable because for the most part everything that happens makes sense but I find it very hard to believe that <spoiler>the doctor's wife, the only person who can see in the asylum, couldn't have prevented the horrific series of gang grapes from happening a little earlier.</spoiler><br/><br/>Always remember to put on your suspension of disbelief pants on before reading and you'll be just fine.<br/><br/>If you're looking to read Blindness at a deeper level to unpack what José Saramago is trying to say about the world we live in, you can do that too.<br/><br/>The blindness could be an allegory for the blind faith some people put in ""God"" (Saramago is an atheist and religion plays a role in Blindness so this isn't much of a stretch) or the socio-economic systems that rule our world, ""capitalism"", or any sort of magical thinking that makes us feel better about our lives and the world we live in.<br/><br/>We delude ourselves into thinking about the world in a way that makes us comfortable. But this prevents us from seeing the world around us as it is and prevents us from being at peace with reality as it is instead of reality as we perceive it to be.<br/><br/>I'm no literary critic so take all this with a grain of salt. Whatever you're looking for in a novel, you're likely to find something to latch onto and keep you hooked reading through Blindness as long as you're able to get past José Saramago's obtuse writing style.<br/><br/>I'm excited to dive deeper into the rest of José Saramago's work having read through two of novels and enjoying both of them (All The Names and Blindness).<br/><br/>If you've got any recommendations for me, send them my way!

9780062073495,2023/10/29,fiction detective-fiction read,read,1,3,"Murder on the Orient Express is similar to Agatha Christie's Death on the Nile (the other Agatha Christie novel I've read recently).<br/><br/>Both novels involve Hercule Poirot on vacation traveling (on a train or on a boat respectively), with the soon-to-be murder victim asking Poirot for help, him declining and then after the murder occurs, Poirot proceeds to solve the murder.<br/><br/>But Death on the Nile was SO MUCH MORE of a compelling read for me. Murder on the Orient Express is... Uhhhhh... Express, it's fast and straightforward. It doesn't waste any time. As soon as possible you're jumping straight into the murder followed by a by-the-numbers solving of the mystery.<br/><br/>It lacks a lot of the charm found in the more patient and denser Death on the Nile. We don't get to learn much about the characters in Murder on the Orient Express which made it hard for me to become invested in them.<br/><br/>This is very unlike Death on the Nile where more than enough time was spent with each character (whether in a flashback or in a present day scene before or after the murder) allowing me to eventually start to understand them, care about them and understand their motives.<br/><br/>Murder on the Orient Express feels very bare bones comparatively. That has probably helped it age a little better compared to Death on the Nile because there's less room for Agatha to hang herself with old school racist slurs, with weird pandering to the 1930s female demographic who (I guess?) really wanted to meet a man and get married, with off the wall bizarre dialogue, etc.<br/><br/>But I kind of enjoyed the parts of Death on the Nile that haven't aged well because those were the bits that stood out to me and were sometimes very funny.<br/><br/>Both books have pretty wild endings, whether you like one or the other will come down to personal preference but Death on the Nile's ending felt a little more earned and realistic to me compared to Murder on the Orient Express's.<br/><br/>If you're really interested in the murder mystery bit of murder mystery novels, you'd be well served reading both of these novels. But if you would prefer to let the murder simmer a little, letting characters develop, witness wild scenes and dialogue and having a better payoff as a result of all this then you might prefer to read Death on the Nile over Murder on the Orient Express.",1

To no one's surprise, Adrian Tchaikovsky is responsible.<br/><br/>Eyes of the Void clicked for me when I realized that Adrian Tchaikovsky is an avid tabletop roleplayer and this novel comes alive because he's basically role-playing (to perfection) all of his characters.<br/><br/>He's thought about (and nailed) the way each character thinks and speaks based on where they're from, who they are, their culture, etc. He's great at this and you can see this in all of his work but The Final Architecture series feels built for him to flex his ability to write great characters.<br/><br/>Another strength of Adrian Tchaikovsky's work is his ability to interweave his world building into the plot as well as the characters in such a way that it all feels meaningful.<br/><br/>He excels at showing instead of telling. When Haever, our favorite spy/neo-noir detective, is having a stressful conversation with his boss, we're told that he has an implant that detected an increase in stress in him and automatically injected him with his heart medication.<br/><br/>This detail serves to set the scene but it also gives us an idea of the level of technology that humans have access to in this universe. This is but one example but the novel is filled with details like this that are pulling their weight by simultaneously fleshing the characters as well as the world they live in.",1
9780552134620,2023/11/13,fiction fantasy comic read,read,1,5,"The first novel in Terry Pratchett's City/Night Watch series featuring the drunk and depressed Captain Vimes, the human who thinks he's a dwarf Carrot, the everyman Nobby and the boomer Sergeant Colon. They act like a tight knit four man improv group, bouncing off each other really well and provide a great foundation for the humor, action and hijinks in the novel.<br/><br/>After reading Thud! and enjoying that, I decided to start reading the entire Discworld City/Night Watch series from the start.<br/><br/>Sam Vimes suffers from a combination of alcoholism and depression leading to his skewed perspective of the world.<br/><br/><b>Lessee . . . he'd gone off after the funeral and got drunk. No, not drunk, another word, ended with ‘er'. Drunker, that was it. Because world all twisted up and wrong, like distorted glass, only came back into focus if you looked at it through bottom of bottle.</b><br/><br/>Carrot is a human who was adopted by dwarven parents and so he's essentially a dwarf in a human body.<br/><br/><b>""Oh, give up!"" he said. ""Are you going to come quietly?"" The mumbling went on. The air began to feel hot and dry. Vimes shrugged. ""That's it, then,"" he said, and turned away. ""Throw the book at him, Carrot."" ""Right, sir."" Vimes remembered too late.</b><br/><br/><b>Dwarfs have trouble with metaphors. They also have a very good aim. The Laws and Ordinances of Ankh and Morpork caught the [...] on the forehead. He blinked, staggered, and stepped backwards. It was the longest step he ever took. For one thing, it lasted the rest of his life.</b><br/><br/>Nobby is the everyman, he is very down to earth.<br/><br/><b>It always amazed Vimes how Nobby got along with practically everyone. It must, he'd decided, have something to do with the common denominator. In the entire world of mathematics there could be no denominator as common as Nobby.</b><br/><br/>Sergeant Colon is the boomer of the group.<br/><br/><b>Sergeant Colon owed thirty years of happy marriage to the fact that Mrs Colon worked all day and Sergeant Colon worked all night. They communicated by means of notes. He got her tea ready before he left at night, she left his breakfast nice and hot in the oven in the mornings. They had three grown-up children, all born, Vimes had assumed, as a result of extremely persuasive handwriting.</b><br/><br/>These are the men who've been tasked with keeping the city safe. Conveniently, Ankh-Morpork quickly finds itself under attack by a powerful force and Captain Vimes and his constables (with a LOT of help from the larger than life noblewoman Lady Sybil Ramkin and her stable of swamp dragons) are the only people standing in the way of the total destruction of the city.<br/><br/>Guards! Guards! is not my favorite of Terry Pratchett's work. It's one of his earlier novels in the Discworld universe so he's still figuring things out.<br/><br/>The parts where the POV shifts away from the Night Watch (and Sybil) are not as compelling and could have probably been edited away.<br/><br/>But, everything else is great. The jokes land. The characters are paper thin and yet somehow Terry manages to make them come to life anyway. Their chemistry is off the charts and it's a joy to read.<br/><br/>Of course, Carrot being a dwarf in a human body can be read as him being autistic (one of many examples of autistic representation in Terry Pratchett's work).<br/><br/>He takes things very literally. He's oblivious to social cues. It's pretty on the nose.<br/><br/>I appreciate this depiction because despite him being a caricature, every other character is too. He's never the butt of the joke, his actions might be what cause a comical situation to occur but we're not laughing at him. We're laughing at the situation that Carrot and the other constables find themselves in.<br/><br/>Carrot, unlike the rest of Night Watch, seems to be genuinely happy about being a constable (proven by the letters he regularly writes to his parents back home). He has a positive outlook on life and is happy to be where he is. Over time, his positive outlook rubs off on the other constables, gets them to get off their asses and get to work helping people.<br/><br/>Carrot is oblivious to the fact that when he first comes to Ankh-Morpork, he's essentially working as a bouncer for a whorehouse (he believes that the Lady of the house just has a bunch of unmarried daughters).<br/><br/>Sure, he's different but that's OK. This is one example of many in Terry Pratchett's work of characters who are really out there and different and people around them love them anyway.<br/><br/>The implication, whether that was Terry's intent or not, is that you can be different in your own way and you can be loved too.<br/><br/>The real world isn't as simple as a Terry Pratchett novel. But his work is a constant reminder that there's at least one person on the planet who understood a part of my struggle and accepts me (and people like me) for who I am.<br/><br/>If there's one person like Terry out there, there's got to be more. Even though Terry passed away in 2015, the positive influence of his work continues to spread and I suspect (and I hope) that many people will continue to enjoy his work for many generations to come.<br/><br/>His work deserves it.",1

A torturer? You may leave the guild, you know, if you prefer.""</b><br/><br/><b>I told him firmly -- and as though I were slightly shocked by the suggestion -- that I had never considered it. It was a lie. I had known, as all the apprentices knew, that one was not firmly and finally a member of the guild until one consented as an adult to the connection. Furthermore, though I loved the guild I hated it too -- not because of the pain it inflicted on clients who must sometimes have been innocent, and who must often have been punished beyond anything that could be justified by their offences; but because it seemed to me inefficient and ineffectual, serving a power that was not only ineffectual but remote. I do not know how better to express my feelings about it than by saying that I hated it for starving and humiliating me and loved it because it was my home, hated and loved it because it was the exemplar of old things, because it was weak, and because it seemed indestructible.</b><br/><br/>An older Severian, sitting on his throne, starts writing the story of his life and how he came into the position of power he's, presumably, currently in. The story begins as a coming of age story with Severian describing his youth as a journeyman in the Torturer's Guild. Eventually, he leaves the Tower he has called home for his entire life and embarks on an adventure becoming an executioner for hire where he roams around, kills people for the state, meets a diverse cast of characters and discovers the, absolutely wild, world he lives in.<br/><br/>Gene Wolfe is known for writing stories from the perspective of characters deeply embedded in the narrative. His Book of the New Sun is no exception. Severian doesn't ever do any exposition or go out his way to explain facets of his world that are obvious to him and obvious to the fictional audience he's writing the story for.<br/><br/>Also, Severian is biased, he disguises the truth, he's not always paying attention to what he should be paying attention to and he can't tell the difference between his memories and his dreams.<br/><br/>All of this puts you as the reader in a state of perpetual confusion and forces you to constantly interpret the events, and re-interpret past events, in the novel as you are exposed to more and more contextual information and details revealed by Severian. This framing for the story combined with the far future setting as well Severian's, let's just say unreliability as a narrator, makes for a compelling read.<br/><br/>The meta-ness of it all with Gene Wolfe writing a story about a torturer in a far future for us, the current day, reader, with this torturer writing about himself from his biased and insane perspective for his audience is very compelling.<br/><br/>I could spend hours discussing any randomly chosen paragraph from the first half of the Book of the New Sun. It's dense, multi-faceted and layered unlike anything I've ever read. It's begging to be read multiple times over which I'm already planning to do despite only being halfway through the series as I write this.<br/><br/>The first part of the The Book of the New Sun was published in 1980, way before the era of trigger warnings in novels. If you're sensitive to that, please inform yourself ahead of time before diving into this series because it's grim as hell and contains many events and themes that some people might find uncomfortable (and understandably so).<br/><br/>Barring that, I can recommend this series, or at least what I've read of it so far, to anyone interested in high concept yet grounded sci-fi/fantasy stories.",1

They annihilated hordes of your empire's military like they were ants.<br/><br/>I don't think it's relevant to ask if the alien being in front of you secretes milk out of its breasts.<br/><br/>I've been poisoned by reading Adrian Tchaikovsky's depiction of aliens in his Children of Time series and his The Final Architecture series.<br/><br/>It's done so well in these novels and comparing those depictions with what we get here makes A Desolation Called Peace look real bad.<br/><br/>I'm frustrated and I'm not sure reading more of this book will help with that.<br/><br/>Reading through more of this book, I don't think Arkady Martine knows what a mammal is or how arbitrary of a distinction it is in the context of her story.<br/><br/>Her characters definitely don't. I cannot believe that the mammal fixation is brought up a second time.<br/><br/>If they're mammals we'll be able to speak with them? Ehhhhhhhhhh<br/><br/>A rushed sequel for a book that greatly surpassed expectations and achieved massive critical success.<br/><br/>The constant inconsistencies, the atrocious way the aliens are handled and described is unbelievably bad, the characters's internal monologues going on and on about nothing relevant.<br/><br/>All of this is exhausting. I enjoyed the previous book in the series despite having a few gripes with it but this one is not a great follow up.<br/><br/>I think it succeeds in some ways. Now that the reader is more familiar with the universe, Martine feels comfortable writing the sequel from multiple POVs, in doing so gives herself the opportunity to give us a better sampling of the world.<br/><br/>Does she succeed fully with this? No. The POVs aren't different enough from one another.<br/><br/>But the book feels forced in a way I haven't seen in a novel in a long time. The author starts off with a message about the book being for/by outsiders. But it's not, it tries to be but it's super forced and is coming not from within the story but from without.<br/><br/>Is this a cynical attempt to capture a particular audience? Maybe? I think it's more likely that Martine doesn't understand that good sci fi comes from imagining worlds that are different from our own and seeing how those differences change things and what it might mean for us.<br/><br/>Instead Martine seems to believe that good sci fi is about creating an interesting world and then moving characters from point A to B while they constantly have temper tantrums, eternally question themselves and their skills and fend off assassination attempts.<br/><br/>Every sentence spoken by a character is followed by interminable internal monologuing. Clearly writing like this comes naturally to Martine and sometimes it works but it's too much here.<br/><br/>It's excruciating to read and completely understand someone DNFing this book midway through.<br/><br/>This novel needed more time in the oven and it would have been way better.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a tad satirical. Don't take me too seriously but please do think twice about reading this novel, even if you really enjoyed the previous one. You might be disappointed like I was.<br/><br/>Here's a few reasons why you might give A Desolation Called Peace by Arkady Martine a 5 star review.<br/>- It won the Hugo award for best novel, just like the previous book in the series. Other people seem to like it, I guess I should like it too?<br/>- Both books in the series combined come out to about 1 thousand pages. After spending that much time with a series, it must be good because otherwise look at all this time I've wasted (Sunk Cost Fallacy)<br/>- I really loved A Memory Called Empire, I guess I like the sequel too?<br/><br/>I respect your point of view even if you disagree with mine. But it's so confusing to me, seeing so many people give this novel a perfect score and gush about it, while completely neglecting the aspects of it that are objectively bad.<br/><br/>This novel feels extremely rushed, it likely was rushed out the door by the publisher so that they could most efficiently capitalize on the unexpected acclaim received by the first book. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel after all.<br/><br/>NB: We do live under capitalism. It is what it is.<br/><br/>All the signs of a rushed release are there if you look closely.<br/>1. Awkward run-on sentences are everywhere and cause the reader psychic damage trying to get through them.<br/><br/>Read the following excerpt out loud to see what I mean:<br/><br/><b>The water she'd drunk made her able to talk [author's note: this sentence is atrocious]. Even sing one of the absurd pitched-consonant words that they'd picked up from the aliens in demonstration for the yaotlek, though Mahit was so much better at making those noises that Three Seagrass had begun to plan a scheme in which she taught her how to have some halfway-decent breath and pitch control, pass on the lessons she'd had as a crèche-kid in how to project from the diaphragm when orating.</b><br/><br/>Reading this novel closely, you can and will find many sentences just like this peppered all throughout the text and reading them will drive you insane.<br/><br/>I hate this kind of writing. I don't know where it comes from. It goes against everything I know about good writing. It drives me up the wall.<br/><br/>NB: If you're like me, I highly recommend you also stay away from Ann Leckie's The Raven Tower which suffers from the same kind of long winded writing.<br/>2. The novel has multiple POV characters and their narratorial voices are way too similar and this will encourage you to start drinking, heavily.<br/><br/>Each bit of dialogue, no matter which character's POV we're following, is interspersed with an ungodly amount of stream of consciousness blahblahblah text that is really annoying to read.<br/><br/>If one character was written like this, it's all good. This narration style would define the character and make them unique, and it wouldn't be so overbearing.<br/><br/>The problem is that every single POV character is written like this because I guess that's how Arkady Martine writes and her editor was not given the time and support they needed this time to take out the trash.<br/><br/>Let's look at some examples: <b>Mahit said, ""Well, that's unexpectedly pleasant, all considered,"" and didn't go on any further. She didn't want to--she couldn't tell Three Seagrass that she was here to spy on the war for Darj Tarats, in order to escape Aknel Amnardbat's surgeons. To do worse things for Darj Tarats, if there was an opportunity. She couldn't. So she got into the shuttle instead, settling amongst the supply crates and strapping herself into some freefall-control webbing. There were similar webbings on all of the walls, the floor, the ceiling. It was an efficie""t, well-designed ship. It must make a hundred of these short hops in a month-- ""Quite,"" said Three Seagrass, all edges, interest and wariness and a sort of invitation deferred: We can play, Mahit, even if we don't play just now, if playing's what you want.</b><br/><br/>Notice that Arkady Martine explicitly cuts off Mahit's stream of consciousness narration here.<br/><br/>This paragraph is actually cool because there's an intentionality to it. The reader is meant to understand that Mahit is someone who is often stuck in her own head. That's awesome characterization.<br/><br/>The issue is that this narrative voice bleeds into every other character's POV.<br/><br/>For example, in this excerpt, Nine Hibiscus has just been informed by a subordinate that the alien's planet has been found.<br/><br/><b>""If we can get there without them seeing us,"" Nine Hibiscus said. The scatterbombs would do exactly what Eighteen Chisel was imagining. They would, yes, blow anyone out of their sky. And then they'd poison that sky, and the planets below it. The scatterbombs were deathrain. A last resort. Almost never used where people lived-- because after them, people didn't live there anymore. She'd only used a scatterbomb barrage once, and that had been against another ship, safe in the blackness of space. The idea of using them on the aliens was-- She liked it too much, was what. Liked it too much, too fast. Such a simple solution. So much easier than the rest of the situation she'd been detailing for herself.</b><br/><br/>Huuuuuuuhhhh. Does this sound familiar? If you replace the names in these excerpts, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.<br/><br/>Notice how frequently Arkady Martine uses the ""--"" (em dash) to cut off her character's neverending internal monologues.<br/><br/>You might be wondering, how did I find these examples? Did I carefully sift truth the entire book for the perfect example to present a skewed representation of the book to make my argument more convincing?<br/><br/>No, I opened my book at a random page and found relevant examples each time because the book is filled with them.<br/>3. Final thoughts because reading this book makes me not want to think anymore.<br/><br/>Reading through A Desolation Called Peace has driven me to the brink of insanity and so I find myself ready and able to talk shit about any part of it.<br/>- Arkady Martine's ignorance about biology and linguistics and her decision to hinge her entire novel on these topics that she clearly knows less than nothing about is infuriating.<br/>- Her fixation on the fact that these aliens are mammals (well sort of, wink wink) and how apparently that ISN'T a completely arbitrary distinction to make is wild. If these aliens secret milk out of their breasts, have vertebra and shit, it is not plot critical, please do not fixate on their mammalness.<br/>- Don't get me started on the title of the novel. Cynically, I understand the sequel of a popular book should probably use a similar naming scheme to the first novel to make it clear that it's a sequel and in doing so sell more copies. But, come on, A Desolation Called Peace, is real dumb.<br/><br/>I feel betrayed by the Goodreads and the science fiction community at large for promoting the apparent perfection of this novel.<br/><br/>Although, there are some heroes out there (you know who you are) who knew the truth and tried their best to communicate it, mostly falling on deaf ears.<br/><br/>I should have listened. Maybe then I wouldn't be headed straight for the mental asylum.<br/><br/>Author's note: this review is a little satirical, please be chill<br/><br/>NB: p. 404, O face due to great diplomacy by Mahit<br/><br/>I've written more than three thousand words between five different first drafts trying to explain exactly why reading A Desolation Called Peace made me so angry. Instead of fumbling with my words, I'll let Ursula K. Le Guin speak for me (quote taken from her essay The Stalin in the Soul).<br/><br/><b>Reading is not a passive reaction, but an action, involving the mind, the emotions, and the will. To accept trashy books because they are ""best-sellers"" is the same thing as accepting adulterated food, ill-made machines, corrupt government, and military and corporative tyranny, and praising them, and calling them the American Way of Life or the American Dream. It is a betrayal of reality. Every betrayal, every lie accepted, leads to the next betrayal and the next lie.</b><br/><br/>Suffice to say that I feel <b>betrayed</b>.<br/><br/>It's clear to me from reading this book closely, that it was rushed to the printing press in an attempt to capitalize on the unexpected (but mostly deserved) acclaim received by the previous book in the series, A Memory Called Empire. With a bit more time in the oven, the sequel could have been fantastic, and yet here we are.<br/><br/>Open the book on any page, put your finger anywhere to find:<br/>- Omnipresent awkward run-on sentences that are begging to be trimmed by a competent editor.<br/>- Multiple POV characters who all suffer from the same never ending stream of consciousness narrative voice that is a pain to read.<br/>- Some absolutely baffling ignorance about aliens, linguistics, the definition of the word ""spy"" and basic biology.<br/><br/>I've rated the book 1 star although it's probably deserving of more (maybe a 2 or a 3), but I need to fight the good fight and do my part to pull this book back into the void where it belongs.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed A Desolation Called Peace, great! Maybe you even rated it 5 stars? Fantastic. I'm truly glad you enjoyed it.<br/><br/>But are you sure that you're really being honest with yourself?<br/><br/>If you don't want to hear what I have to say, fine, but at least listen to Chad Le Guin. If we continue to accept slop like this, praise its greatness, and put it on a pedestal, publishers have no incentive to give authors and editors the time they need to do their best work.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm wrong? Maybe this is really one of the best sci-fi novels of our generation? Maybe the author and the editor and everyone involved got all the time they needed to make A Desolation Called Peace the best it could be.<br/><br/>Well then, if A Desolation Called Peace is the peak of what modern sci-fi can bring to the table, I don't want to read it anymore.",1

The main character D-503 lives in a dystopian society based on 1920s Soviet Russia. A society that is built upon conformity and unity of action, it expects people to act as identical cogs in the machine.<br/><br/>Why does a trans reading work IMO? Throughout the novel, our protagonist D-503 begins to diverge from this uniformity through some means outside of his control (he gets a soul) and also begins to experience a form of body dysmorphia (and also his hairy palms).<br/><br/>Great works of art can be re-interpreted and re-evaluated throughout time. Art does not exist in a vacuum, art exists and manifests itself within the experience of the person experiencing the art.<br/><br/>My recent foray into slav sci fi (Stanislaw Lem's Solaris and The Futurological Congress, Strugatsky Brothers's Roadside Picnic and Yevgeny Zamyatin's We) has been quite fruitful. I've vibed with these works in a bunch of different ways. They've tended to be shorter works that don't waste time and are more than just a sequence of events like a lot of modern sci fi seems to be these days.<br/><br/>Low key goated.

Part of me would have liked some of the exposition and reveals that happen there to have been revealed more evenly throughout the book but I can't deny that back loading it all made for a more powerful ending.<br/><br/>I think that labeling a book that features this many traumatic situations (serious bullying, attempted sexual violence, suicide, child cancer/death) as <b>cozy</b> is a farce.

Philip Gabriel repeats this wording 3 times in the next few sentences.<br/><br/>Generally, I've been disappointed with translations of Japanese works because it seems like Japanese is such a hard language to learn that it's hard to find a translator who's both fluent and a great writer. Ideally, translators should be better at writing than the authors of the texts they translate. Why? So they can write a text that both stands on its own and adapts the original faithfully while changing it enough to make it compelling for a new audience.<br/><br/>Philip Gabriel did a fine job here from what I can tell, but the text could have used another editing pass.",1
