# TODO

- Fix css on mobile for the floating button staying focused after click
    - probably just a fix on the css
- Add more greetings
- Add normal footer to album pages in a reasonable way (must look good on desktop or mobile)
- Make markdown headers clickable (#title)
- Add ids to blog title and make them clickable too URLXX.COM/#title
- Fix images size in blog posts, check "Books I read in 2021" for an example of this
