# TODO

- Fix css on mobile for the floating button staying focused after click
    - probably just a fix on the css
- Figure out how to do markdown reference
- Add more greetings
- Add normal footer to album pages in a reasonable way (must look good on desktop or mobile)
- Combine all ramble posts into one row on the table (one row for the latest one and then a "summary" for the rest linking to the ramble tag page
