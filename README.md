# TODO

## General
- create a meme page template for pictures (given a folder, go through each of them)
- make interactive CV
- share button:
    - improve share/another button visibility on a dark background
    - improve visibility and placement of another/share button on desktop

## Post-Hugo
- Make paginator skip rambles

## bin/
- Create rap name generator (lil X)

- give the random button a bit of a left margin
- change the button ordering so that the blog is on the right then tools then cocktails then food
- implement a single button menu on mobile that expands vertically into a few more buttons
- flip the post paginator previous and next buttons, they make more sense that way


# Ideas
- X things I like about Blades in the Dark
- Knotwords vs. Dominions 5 (comparing what each game experience is like and how different they are, how they're similar)
