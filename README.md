# TODO

- Fix css on mobile for the floating button staying focused after click
    - probably just a fix on the css
- Figure out how to do markdown reference
- Add more greetings
- Remove star rating from cocktails, they're not useful for other people
    - Turn it into hidden field used for sorting and for myself
- Add normal footer to album pages in a reasonable way (must look good on desktop or mobile)
