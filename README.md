# TODO


- Change the favicons with a new logo
- Fix css on mobile for the floating button staying focused after click
    - probably just a fix on the css
- Create a better home page with summaries for my blog post
    - https://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/
    - I want blurbs for my posts to display on my main page
- Add sole, potato thing, alfredo penne recipes to my site
- implement erb code to insert an image with optional caption inline of a blog post
- add tooltips to words like "Build" and "Shake and strain" to explain what I mean by them
- improve cocktail sorting function to take other factors into account
- Reevaluate use of CDNs vs. providing the files locally
- Reorganize images to be placed in a folder named the same as the blog, so that we can simplify the logic we use to tie images to blog posts

UNICODE TAGS NOT WORKING
dont use unicode in backend, use ascii then replace with emoji on the page (check page_tags function, use a config file to ascii to emoji values. Do the same for the food pretty print code)
